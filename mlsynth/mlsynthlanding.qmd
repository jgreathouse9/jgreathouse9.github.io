title: "MLSYNTH"
subtitle: "A Machine Learning Synthetic Control Library Using Python"
---

This is the landing page for the mini-ecosystem `mlsynth`.

**Contributors**: Jared Greathouse

**Status**: Beta version released. Documentation and app are in active development.

## Philosophy

The mlsynth library implements machine learning based synthetic control estimators. It offers a convenient API, unlike other libraries which rely on numerous methods for plotting, weights, and estimation. Instead, mlsynth classes rely on a simple `.fit()` method to run any given estiamtor, where users may customize the options via a simple input dictionary.

## GitHub Repo

Here is the GitHub [repo](https://github.com/jgreathouse9/mlsynth). You may install mlsynth by doing

```bash
pip install -U git+https://github.com/jgreathouse9/mlsynth.git
```

in your terminal.

## Documentation

Here is the link to the [documentation](https://mlsynth.readthedocs.io).

## App

Here is the beta version of [the app](https://mlsynthapp.streamlit.app/) which runs many of the mlsynth estimators.

## Projects:

Here are the projects which use `mlsynth`. Please let me know if yours does and I will add it!
