Synthetic interventions generalize synthetic control methods to settings with multiple treatment arms and counterfactual treatment effects. Rather than estimating what would have occurred under no intervention, synthetic interventions estimate what would have occurred under a different intervention.

SI estimates how a treated unit would have performed under an alternative intervention it did not actually receive, using outcomes from units that did receive that intervention. Unlike traditional synthetic control methods, which estimate untreated potential outcomes (i.e., how a treated unit would have performed with no intervention), SI estimates alternative treated potential outcomes (i.e., how a treated unit would have performed under a different intervention).

In standard synthetic control (SCM), we aim to estimate the outcome for a treated unit if it had not been treated at all. In synthetic interventions, by contrast, we aim to estimate the outcome for a treated unit if it had received a different intervention than the one it actually received.

A retail chain might roll out different loyalty programs across its stores. For instance, Store A adopts a cash-back program (Program A), Store B adopts a points-based program (Program B), and Store C adopts a discount coupon program (Program C). Observing outcomes like revenue and customer visits under each program, a natural question would be: *How would Store A have performed if it had adopted Program B instead of Program A?* Using synthetic interventions, one could construct a synthetic version of Store A under Program B, based on observed outcomes from stores that actually implemented Program B, thereby estimating the counterfactual revenue and customer behavior under the alternative program.

In policy, cities implement different public health interventions targeting soda consumption. For example, City 1 bans the sale of large sodas, City 2 imposes a tax on sugary drinks, and City 3 mandates calorie labeling on menus. Observing health outcomes such as obesity rates and soda sales across these cities, we might ask: *What if City 1 had imposed a soda tax instead of banning large sodas?* Using synthetic interventions, we could construct a synthetic version of City 1 under the soda tax policy, using observed outcomes from cities that actually taxed sugary drinks, and estimate how soda consumption and public health outcomes would have differed.

SI allow researchers to simulate and compare the effects of alternative treatments rather than just the placebo counterfactual. This substantially expands the range of counterfactual questions that can be credibly answered.

# Notation

Scalars are denoted by lowercase italic letters such as $g$. Vectors are denoted by bold lowercase letters such as $\mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{R}^n$. Matrices are denoted by bold uppercase letters such as $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$. Sets are denoted by calligraphic letters such as $\mathcal{N}$ and $\mathcal{T}$. The cardinality of a finite set $\mathcal{A}$ is denoted $|\mathcal{A}|$.

Let $\mathcal{N} = \{1, 2, \dots, N\}$ index the units and $\mathcal{T} = \{1, 2, \dots, T\}$ index time periods. Let $\mathcal{D} = \{0, 1, \dots, D\}$ index treatment statuses, with $0$ denoting the untreated condition. Each unit $j \in \mathcal{N}$ is assigned a treatment $d_j \in \mathcal{D}$. 

Define $T_0 < T$ as the final pre-treatment period and partition $\mathcal{T}$ into pre-treatment periods $\mathcal{T}_{\text{pre}} = \{1, 2, \dots, T_0\}$ and post-treatment periods $\mathcal{T}_{\text{post}} = \{T_0 + 1, \dots, T\}$. Let $\mathbf{y}_j^{\text{pre}} \in \mathbb{R}^{T_0}$ denote the pre-treatment outcome vector for unit $j$ and $\mathbf{y}_j^{\text{post}} \in \mathbb{R}^{T - T_0}$ denote its post-treatment outcomes. For a group of units assigned to treatment $d$, define $\mathbf{Y}_d^{\text{pre}} \in \mathbb{R}^{T_0 \times N_d}$ as the matrix stacking the pre-treatment outcomes of units $j \in \mathcal{N}_d$, and $\mathbf{Y}_d^{\text{post}} \in \mathbb{R}^{T - T_0 \times N_d}$ as the corresponding post-treatment outcome matrix.

Let $\mathcal{N}_d = \{ j \in \mathcal{N} \mid d_j = d \}$ denote the set of units exposed to treatment $d$. At each $(t, j)$ pair, we observe only $y_{t j} = y^*_{t j d_j}$, the realized outcome under the assigned treatment. Our goal is to estimate the counterfactual post-treatment trajectory $\{ y^*_{t 1 d} \}_{t \in \mathcal{T}_{\text{post}}}$ for a focal unit $j = 1$ that actually received treatment $d_1$, where $d \neq d_1$ represents an alternative treatment.

Although the framework models potential outcomes as forming a low-rank tensor across units, time, and treatments, estimation proceeds entirely through matrix methods. In practice, synthetic interventions reduce to applying principal components regression (PCR) to the pre-treatment donor matrix composed of units assigned to the alternative treatment $d$. There is no tensor decomposition step. The synthetic intervention estimator constructs a synthetic counterfactual trajectory by learning weights from pre-treatment data and then imputing post-treatment outcomes using observed outcomes from the alternative treatment group.

# Econometric Model

Synthetic interventions assume that potential outcomes admit a low-rank latent factor structure. Formally, each potential outcome $y_{t j d}^*$ for unit $j$ at time $t$ under treatment $d$ is generated by
$$
y_{t j d}^* = \mathbf{l}_t^\top \mathbf{f}_j^{(d)} + \varepsilon_{t j d},
$$
where $\mathbf{l}_t \in \mathbb{R}^r$ is a vector of time-specific latent factors, $\mathbf{f}_j^{(d)} \in \mathbb{R}^r$ is a vector of unit- and treatment-specific loadings, and $\varepsilon_{t j d}$ is an idiosyncratic error term with mean zero. The dimension $r$ is assumed to be small relative to $T$ and $N$.

The interactive structure implies that the tensor of potential outcomes across $(t, j, d)$ admits a low-rank decomposition. The principal components of the pre-treatment donor matrix $\mathbf{Y}_d^{\text{pre}}$ consistently estimate the column space of $\{ \mathbf{l}_t \}$ up to rotation, under standard conditions. Consequently, by projecting pre-treatment outcomes onto this estimated subspace and regressing the treated unit onto the donors, we can recover consistent estimates of the treated unit’s counterfactual trajectory under alternative treatments.

The key identification assumption is that the latent factor structure is stable across treatments and time, and that the donor group shares sufficient commonality with the treated unit to span its pre-treatment behavior.

## Assumptions

The validity of the synthetic interventions estimator relies on assumptions similar to standard synthetic control methods. First, the tensor of potential outcomes admits a low-rank decomposition. The number of latent factors $r$ is small relative to the number of time periods and units. Second, the latent factor structure is stable across treatments and over time. The factors $\mathbf{l}_t$ and loadings $\mathbf{f}_j^{(d)}$ do not change discontinuously due to treatment assignment. Third, the donor units assigned to the alternative treatment $d$ span the relevant factor space needed to approximate the treated unit’s pre-treatment outcomes. Fourth, the idiosyncratic error terms $\varepsilon_{t j d}$ are mean-zero and satisfy weak regularity conditions such as independence across units or bounded variance. Finally, there is sufficient pre-treatment data to accurately estimate the principal components of the donor matrix.

# Recalling PCR

To estimate the counterfactual trajectory under an alternative treatment $d \neq d_1$, we apply singular value decomposition (SVD) to the pre-treatment donor matrix $\mathbf{Y}_d^{\text{pre}} \in \mathbb{R}^{T_0 \times N_d}$. This yields the decomposition
$$
\mathbf{Y}_d^{\text{pre}} = \mathbf{U} \mathbf{\Sigma} \mathbf{V}^\top,
$$
where $\mathbf{U} \in \mathbb{R}^{T_0 \times T_0}$ contains the left singular vectors, $\mathbf{\Sigma} \in \mathbb{R}^{T_0 \times N_d}$ is the diagonal matrix of singular values, and $\mathbf{V} \in \mathbb{R}^{N_d \times N_d}$ contains the right singular vectors.

To obtain a low-dimensional representation, we truncate the decomposition at rank $r \leq T_0$. Let $\mathbf{U}_r \in \mathbb{R}^{T_0 \times r}$ denote the first $r$ columns of $\mathbf{U}$, and let $\mathbf{\Sigma}_r \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times r}$ denote the leading $r$ singular values on the diagonal. Define the reduced-rank basis
$$
\tilde{\mathbf{Y}}_d^{\text{pre}} = \mathbf{U}_r \mathbf{\Sigma}_r.
$$

We then project the treated unit's pre-treatment outcomes $\mathbf{y}_1^{\text{pre}} \in \mathbb{R}^{T_0}$ onto the donor space by solving the regression problem
$$
\mathbf{w}^\ast = \arg\min_{\mathbf{w} \in \mathbb{R}^{N_d}} \left\| \mathbf{y}_1^{\text{pre}} - \mathbf{Y}_d^{\text{pre}} \mathbf{w} \right\|_2^2.
$$

This yields a weight vector $\mathbf{w}^*$ over the donor units in $\mathcal{N}_d$, constrained to lie in the subspace spanned by the leading principal components of the donor group. The estimated counterfactual trajectory for unit 1 under treatment $d$ is then constructed by applying these weights to the observed post-treatment outcomes:
$$
\hat{\mathbf{y}}_1^{\text{post}} = \mathbf{Y}_d^{\text{post}} \mathbf{w}^\ast.
$$

This quantity serves as an estimate for $\{y^*_{t 1 d}\}_{t \in \mathcal{T}_{\text{post}}}$, the counterfactual outcomes that unit 1 would have experienced had it received treatment $d$ instead of $d_1$.
