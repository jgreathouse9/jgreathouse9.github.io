{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:fdid} estimates the average treatment effect on the treated
for settings where we have one treated unit and multiple control units.
It uses an iterative forward selection algorithm to select the optimal
control group. After selecting the optimal control group, {cmd:fdid} calculates the treatment effect
along with confidence intervals. Note that the dependent variable must be numeric, 
non-missing and non-constant. The {opt tr:eated} variable must be a dummy
variable equal to one when the unit is treated, else 0.
{cmd: fdid} requires the data to be {cmd: xtset} and balanced.

{opt gr1opts}: edits the display of the observed versus predicted plot. It accepts the string literally as is. For example,
{cmd: fdid gdp, tr(treat) unitnames(state) gr1opts(scheme(sj) name(hcw, replace))} returns a plot formatted in the most recent version of the Stata Journal's scheme, with the plot being named hcw.

{phang}
{opt unitnames}: {cmd: fdid} presumes the panel variable has value labels, where a number is indexed to a string. However, if this is not the case, then the user simply specifies the string variable they wish to use as the panel variable's names. Note that each string number pair must be uniquely identified.

{pstd}
For theoretical justification and more details on the method overall, see ({browse "https://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2022.0212":the original paper}).
Note, that in theory we may extend {cmd: fdid} to situations where there are many treated units at different points in time. However, at the moment
{cmd: fdid} only supports settings where there's one treated unit. As a workaround, assuming the treatment period begins at the same time for all units,
the user may iteratively estimate treatment effects for each treated unit (omitting the other treated units from the control group) and then
take the average of their treatment effects and confidence intervals.

{title:Saved Results}

{p 4 8 2}
{cmd:fdid} ereturns the following results, which 
can be displayed by typing {cmd: ereturn list} after 
{cmd: fdid} is finished (also see {help ereturn}).  

{p 8 8 2}
{cmd: e(ATTs):}{p_end}
{p 10 10 2}
A matrix that contains the ATT, standard error, and the upper and lower bounds of the 95% Confidence Interval.
It also has the R-squared and Root-Mean-Squared Error statistics for the pre-intervention period.

{p 8 8 2}
{cmd: e(selected) :}{p_end}
{p 10 10 2}
A macro containing the list of selected units chosen by the forward selection algorithm.

{synoptline}

{title:Frames}
{p 4 8 2}
{cmd:fdid} returns frames for the user's convenience.

{p 4 8 2}
{cmd:cfframe}: Contains the outcome vector for the treated unit, the counterfactual vector, the time period, and the pointwise treatment effect.
