# Philosophy

The mlsynth library implements machine learning based synthetic control estimators for program evaluation. It offers a simple and convenient API which to implement multiple flavors of synthetic control estimator. Unlike other libraries which rely on numerous methods, mlsynth classes rely on a simple `.fit()` method to run any given class, where users may customize the estiamtor and reporting via options they input into a dictionary.
