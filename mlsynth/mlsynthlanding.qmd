## Philosophy

The mlsynth library implements machine learning based synthetic control estimators. It offers a convenient API, unlike other libraries which rely on numerous methods for plotting, weights, and estimation. Instead, mlsynth classes rely on a simple `.fit()` method to run any given estiamtor, where users may customize the options via a simple input dictionary.

# Repo

## Documentation

This is the link to the [docs](https://mlsynth.readthedocs.io) for all the estimators in question.

## App

Here is the beta version of [the app](https://mlsynthapp.streamlit.app/) which runs many of the mlsynth estimators.
