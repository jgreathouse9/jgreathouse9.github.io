# Forward DID (fdid for Stata)

<details>
  <summary>Extended Description</summary>
  <p><i>Choosing a control group is vital to quasi-experimental design in the social sciences. When randomized trials are not feasible or ethical, researchers (usually) need to compare a treated unit/set of units to others that were untreated. To do this, fdid uses a greedy forward selection algorithm to choose the ideal control group for the currently treated unit. It then uses the standard difference-in-differences model to estimate effects. The fdid command reports a full suite of inferential statistics, metrics of fit, as well as the control units used for the difference-in-differences design.</i></p>

The Stata [vignette](https://github.com/jgreathouse9/FDIDTutorial/blob/main/StataVignette.md) for this command may be found here. It replicates the results of [Li (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2022.0212) who uses [HCW (2012)](https://doi.org/10.1002/jae.1230) as an example. The paper describing the Stata command is forthcoming, and is joint work with Jason Coupet and Eric Sevigny.
