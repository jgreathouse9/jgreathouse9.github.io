    "text": "In academia, many datasets we work with come in pretty csv files. And while that’s great… oftentimes, in modern policy data science, the data we seek are unstructured in the sense that they do not come from a specific file such as a .csv file or Stata dataset. Such data must be web-scraped, or the process of gathering unstructured data, via reproducible script.\nThis post simply seeks to present a simple use case of web-scraping in the setting the applied policy scientist might need for certain tasks. Say we wish to gather the price of gas from AAA, across each metro area in the nation. In the old days, we’d need to ask AAA and pay thousands of dollars for an extended time series… but now we don’t need to, at least for this case. The reason is because we have Python, and we are able to leverage its basic features to collect these data via exploiting the publicly available information they provide us."

For Massachusetts, the URL is “https://gasprices.aaa.com/?state=MA”. For Florida, the URL is “https://gasprices.aaa.com/?state=FL”. See the pattern? There’s a common prefix, with the only thing changing being the suffix of which is the abbreviation of the state.\nThe master function is fetch_gas_prices. This simply accepts a dictionary of state abbreviations (the value) paired with the key (the state name) we shall query over. We, within this function, define a common time mapping which AAA uses to stnadardize dates, and specify the current date.\nNext I use Python’s requests library to query each state (plenty of ways to do this step, but requests is generally the quickest for simple and even fairly big jobs). I then process each state with the process_states function. This accepts a list of states, headers, the common time mapping, and the current date. We then query each state, and clean the accordion-style tables that we see towards the bottom of the page. We clean them for each city/each metro area with the process_city_data function. Then append all of them into a single dataframe for each state, moving on to the next state after we’ve axhausted all metros for that state. Finally we appened the state dataframes together, where we have the date, the prices of gas, the state, and the city name all in one place."

I’ve done more complicated scrapes, such as scraping the prices of goods across every Whole Foods in the country across 5 different departments per store. The scale of the job and the size of the data is much bigger, but the principles are overall the same. In the future, I will write more posts that demonstrate different applications of web-scraping and how policy scientists may use them. In particular, I will cover how scraping can go hand in hand with GitHub Actions. In my experience so far as a PHD student, these two alone (scraping and Github Actions) has made my life as a researcher far easier than otherwise."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Man, I hate industry jargon. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not against all jargon. I’ve been in academia ten years, and I’ve spent maybe 6 of those being tormented by econometrics. We have our own jargon too, which doesn’t always jive very well with industry- I say “causal inference”, marketers will say “incrementality testing”. I say “experiment”, others say “A/B testing”. I say “practical significance”, others say “value”. There’s something about the data science industry lingo that irritates me. “Ambiguity” (I’ll do a post on this one, one day). “Self starter”. “Business acumen”. And the favorite of the day, “actionable insights.” This post is dedicated to showing you how I think about actionable insights. I approach this from the perspective of somebody who cares a lot about causal inference. I would like to focus on how we can use causal methods from econometrics to deliver actionable insights… But I’m getting ahead of myself.\n“Actionable insights”. It’s what we hear about all the time, even if it isn’t phrased exactly like that. Job descriptions and data science pages will go on and on about how we’re meant to deliver them as econometricians, policy analysts, and data scientists. Our livelihoods are essentially staked to producing them. But, what are actionable insights anyways? Some pages say ““Actionable insights” describes contextualised data analysis. It’s a piece of information that can actually be put into action — supported by the analysis, context and communication tools required to get the job done.” I agree with this. This leads us to one question then: how do we know which insights are actionable? And, more pressingly, how do we prodcue these in the first place?\n\n\nRecently I saw a post on LinkedIn. It went something like this:\n\nData Science Intern: “This is a chart of our App download trends.” Client: “So?”\n\n\nJunior Data Scientist: “The chart shows that downloading of the App increased by 45%, compared to the same time yesteryear.” Client: “Great! Why?”\n\n\nPrincipal Data Scientist: “The chart shows that downloading of the App increased by 45%, compared to the same time yesteryear due to our new pricing strategy. We should roll out Pricing Strategy in more markets since it’ll likely increase revenue by Big Amount.” Client: “That’s great! We’ll get right to it.”\n\nIn context, the post was about connecting your results to the next steps of actions businesses/clients should take, saying that context is key to making business recommendations. And that’s great, we should all be doing that. But I find the hypothetical Principal DS’s answer to be quite wanting. I do not understand why we are meant to see the Principal DS’s remarks as any more wise than the Junior DS. Why?\nThe Principal DS was implicitly making a counterfactual claim in this example. They were explaining to the client that their Policy W had X impact on Outcome Y, an even went as far as to say that if we kept doing Policy W, we may see gains elsewhere in the future. And this may be true. But how can we tell? For all the talk we have about showing impact (instead of telling what you did descriptively), surely we can do better than this. How? Causal inference.\nHere is my issue with the post: the second you add the phrase “Impact X happened given our new pricing strategy/policy/other intervention”, we’re now very far aflung from Descriptiville, stuck in Counterfactual Land. In this domain, the laws work differently. You will never get by if the most you can do is simply getting Tableau/BI to make us a chart. Here you see, we need to have some estimate of how sales (or whatever metric we’re meant to care about) would’ve evolved ABSENT whatever the new policy was. Put differently, you can’t just show a bar chart and say “You should do X cuz I made this chart and have verbally attached an explanation to why we see a number”. It requires A LOT more work than that."

    "text": "Defining the Problem\nSuppose we work for Uber. Uber introduced Uber Green in September of 2020, as an initiative that is meant to (among other things) incentivize drivers to use electric cars/low emissions vehicles. Suppose our supervisor tasks us with evaluating whether this policy in fact affected the number of drivers who use electric cars, as was the intended goal. Given this situation, we must roll out this intervention someplace first in order to see how it may work in other markets (say, Sayulita, Mexico), and we must generate a counterfactual. Or, the number of drivers who would have used electric cars but for Uber Green’s introduction. In order to accomplish this task, I will use synthetic control based methodologies to estimate the impact. Of course, the goal here is to compute the average treatment effect on the treated, or the average of the differences between our treated unit and the out-of-sample predictions (post intervention period). This allows us to have a summary statistic of the causal effect, as an averge or as a total."

    "text": "Solving the Problem\n\nLet \\(\\mathcal{N}\\) denote the set of cities indexed by \\(j\\), where \\(N \\coloneqq |\\mathcal{N}|\\) represents the total number of markets. Sayulita, the treated city, is indexed by \\(j = 1\\), while the set of control cities is denoted by \\(\\mathcal{N}_0 \\coloneqq \\mathcal{N} \\setminus \\{1\\}\\), with cardinality \\(N_0 \\coloneqq |\\mathcal{N}_0|\\). Time periods are indexed by \\(t\\), with pre-intervention periods \\(\\mathcal{T}_1 \\coloneqq \\{1, 2, \\dots, T_0\\}\\) and post-intervention periods \\(\\mathcal{T}_2 \\coloneqq \\{T_0+1, \\dots, T\\}\\), where \\(T_0\\) is the last period before the intervention.\nFor each market \\(j\\), let \\(\\mathbf{y}_j \\coloneqq [y_{jt}, \\dots, y_{jT}]^\\top \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T}\\) represent the vector of new drivers who use electric cars, where \\(y_{jt}\\) denotes the number of weekly new drivers in market \\(j\\) at time \\(t\\). Let \\(\\mathbf{Y}_0 \\coloneqq (\\mathbf{y}_j)_{j \\in \\mathcal{N}_0} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times N_0}\\) be the matrix of control markets that did not do this intervention at this time. To estimate the counterfactual new driver supply in Sayulita, we construct a synthetic control by taking some weighted average of the control markets based on their pre-intervention trends, \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}_1(0) = \\mathbf{Y}_0 \\mathbf{w}^\\top\\), where \\(\\mathbf{w} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N_0}\\) is a vector of weights assigned to the control cities. These weights are chosen to minimize some loss function. The treatment effect at time \\(t\\) is then estimated as the difference between the observed and counterfactual outcomes, \\(\\widehat{\\Delta}_t \\coloneqq y_{1t} - \\hat{y}_{1t}(0)\\). Our result of interest is the average of these treatment effects over the post-intervention period:\n\\[\n\\widehat{ATT} \\coloneqq \\mathbb{E}_2[\\widehat{\\Delta}_t] = \\frac{1}{T_2} \\sum_{t \\in \\mathcal{T}_2} \\widehat{\\Delta}_t.\n\\]\nIf the introduction of Uber Green in Sayulita leads to an increase in the number of new drivers who use electric vehicles, we expect \\(\\widehat{\\Delta}_t\\), we can then comment on how this program may be applied to other areas.[^1]. The observed new drivers who use electric cars in Sayulita follows a factor model:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{y}_1 = \\mathbf{\\Gamma} \\mathbf{F} + \\boldsymbol{\\nu}_1 + \\boldsymbol{\\delta} \\mathbb{1}(t \\geq T_0),\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{\\Gamma} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times k}\\) represents the factor loadings, \\(\\mathbf{F} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{k \\times T}\\) is the matrix of latent common factors, and the factors evolve as:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{F}_t = \\rho \\mathbf{F}_{t-1} + \\boldsymbol{\\eta}_t, \\quad \\boldsymbol{\\eta}_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{0}, \\mathbf{I}_k),\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\rho\\) is the autocorrelation parameter and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\eta}_t\\) is a noise term. The idiosyncratic error term, \\(\\boldsymbol{\\nu}_1\\), is assumed to follow a normal distribution with zero mean and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), i.e., \\(\\boldsymbol{\\nu}_1 \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{0}, \\sigma^2 \\mathbf{I})\\). The treatment effect vector \\(\\boldsymbol{\\delta} \\coloneqq [\\delta_{T_0+1}, \\dots, \\delta_T]^\\top\\) represents the change in driver supply due to the Uber Green intervention, which is assumed to affect Sayulita starting at time \\(T_0+1\\).\n\nLet’s begin by plotting our outcome. The plot depicts the weekly new Uber drivers who have switched to electric vehicles. Sayulita is our target unit in black, the average of the control group is the thin red line, and the thin grey line are our donors that didn’t enact the intervention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA few things are apparent: for one, the parallel trends assumption doesn’t apply here across the 75 pre-treatment periods. The mean of controls doesn’t mirror the trend of Sayulita. So, we must use something a little more sophisticated than the standard Difference-in-Differences method. Furthermore, these donors have pretty noisy outcome series. Fortunately, we can exploit the low rank structure of our control group and use that to learn the weights which reconstructs the pre-intervention time series for our treated unit. I’ve written more about this here. Basically, we denoise the data via PCA or functional analysis, and cluster over the functional representation of control units or their right singular values, and extract the donor pool from this low-rank representation. We can then use principal component regression or robust principal component regression to learn our unit weights.\nWhen we do this, we obtain these predictions, of course using my mlsynth to fit the pre-intervention period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetric\nRSC\nRPCASC\n\n\n\n\n0\nPre-Treatment RMSE\n1.263\n2.285\n\n\n1\nATT\n14.875\n17.312\n\n\n2\nPercent ATT\n22.473\n27.154\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that both the Robust PCA Synthetic Control and the Robust Synthetic Control/Principal Component Regression methods fit Sayulita quite well in the pre-intervention period. They also have very similar ATTs, suggesting that Uber Green increased new electric vehicle use amongst its drivers by anywhere from 22.473 to 26.425 percent. The normal ATTs are also pretty close to the what I simulated, an ATT of 15. Next, I’ll simulate the ATT using Forward Difference-in-Differences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetric\nFDID\nDID\n\n\n\n\n0\nATT\n15.527\n14.957\n\n\n1\nPre-Treatment RMSE\n2.315\n5.572\n\n\n2\nPercent ATT\n23.691\n22.624\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we plot the results of the standard Difference-in-Differences design and the Forward DID method. As we can see, parallel pre-intervention trends doesn’t hold at all. The selected parallel trends made by FDID is a lot more sensible in this instance, fitting as well as the synthetic control methods as above.\nJust to go really crazy, I decided to combine my estimates into a convex average. Let \\(K\\) denote the number of counterfactual models, in our case 3. Define \\(\\mathbf{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times K}\\) as the matrix of counterfactual vectors, where each column corresponds to a model and each row represents a time period. The optimization problem is formulated as:\n\\[\n\\min_{\\mathbf{w} \\in \\Delta_K} \\left\\| \\mathbf{y}_1 - \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{w} \\right\\|_2\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) belongs to the simplex:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{w} \\in \\Delta_K = \\left\\{ \\mathbf{w} \\in \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}^K \\mid \\left\\| \\mathbf{w} \\right\\|_1 = 1 \\right\\},\n\\]\nor the set spanned by the convex hull of the differing model predictions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ATT we compute is 14.902. Just as a very technical note, we see that the RMSE here with the model averaged estimator is lower than any other model I’ve estimated so far. This is because of Jensen’s inequality. Jensen’s inequality states that for a convex function \\(f\\) and a set of inputs, the function’s value at the weighted average is less than or equal to the weighted average of the function’s inputs:\n\\[\nf\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{K} w_k A_k\\right) \\leq \\sum_{k=1}^{K} w_k f(A_k).\n\\]\nIn our case, we consider the function of the MSE. Due to the quadratic term, \\(f(x) = x^2\\), we have a convex function. Applying Jensen’s inequality to our loss function, we have\n\\[\n\\text{MSE}(\\mathbf{w}^\\top \\mathbf{A}) = \\mathbb{E} \\left[ (\\mathbf{y}_1 - \\mathbf{w}^\\top \\mathbf{A})^2 \\right] \\leq \\sum_{k=1}^{K} w_k \\mathbb{E} \\left[ (\\mathbf{y}_1 - A_k)^2 \\right],\n\\]\nwhich essentially guarantees that our model averaged pre-treatment MSE must be lower than the MSE of one of these models by themselves."

Instead of simply speculating, we can say, for example,\n\nWe simulated the effect of Uber Green four times. Our best estimates suggest that the percentage of new drivers who use electric cars increased between 22.473 and 26.4 percent in the weeks following the Uber Green program being introduced (I also here might use the Bayesian prediction intervals from RSC to comment on uncertainty). When we combined our best three models together, Uber Green added 15 more electric car drivers on average per week. The program added around 488 more electric car drivers than what we would’ve seen otherwise. We would need to roll out the program in new areas for more confirmation, but the evidence suggests Uber Green increases electric car usage.\n\nSee how I’m not simply speculating with a bar chart? The value added here is that I’m simulating the universe where what did happen, did not happen, and then I’m tentatively suggesting that we implement the program elsewhere based off my findings, not a simple analysis of trends. The potential outcomes framework, when implemented judiciously, directly suggests what should or should not be done based off the treatment effects and uncertainty.\nThis is even more evident when we consider the actual presentation of my results. I’m actually showing the client the effect of the program, not just telling them. I am presenting them an explicit picture of how the world would look if they didn’t do their policy or intervention. This is the great thing about synthetic control methods (and other methods like Difference-in-Differences event studies) ; they’re very visual designs. They can be explained to people who have 0 training with and are easy to follow. The treatment effect of Uber Green here pops right out at you, mkaing the choice (more drivers being better than less drivers) obvious. What’s more, the assumptions of my model can can (sometimes) explicitly be defended, instead of sort of arguing from intuition.\nWhile I can’t predict how the treatment would behave in other markets (well I lied, I kinda can), the econometric approach of testing for causal impacts presents a far more compelling picture than me simply saying “Hey this bar chart shows an effect and I’m gonna speculate the effect is cuz of this policy.” This is why I say causal inference runs the world: assuming we expect our policies to impact people and increase value for our clients, doing rigourous impact analysis is key to assess whether we are actual in fact doing that."

The vanilla method suffers from interpolation biases in the case when the donor pool is not suitable for the target unit. This is farily common with applied SCM in real life, as oftentimes we may have a high-dimensional donor pool and not know what the right control units would be a priori. The standard advice given in this instance is to limit our control group to units that are already similar to the target unit. But how do we do this? One way is to use clustering methods to select the control group. Consider the classic Basque Country example below, where the Basque Country undergoes a wave of terrorism in the mid-1970s which is thought to impact their GDP per Capita relative to other areas of Spain.\nHere, we plot the Basque versus the average of its controls as well as the individual donor outcome vectors themselves. We can see that the Basque Country is one of the wealthiest areas of Spain, up there with Madrid, Cataluna, and the Balearic Islands. We have other donors too, which by comparison are less wealthy. The key, then, is to ask which donors we should select for the synthetic control algorithm to consider in the first place, by exploiting pre-intervention similarities between the treated unit and control group. With “better” pre-policy donors, there is a higher chance that our out-of-sample predictions would be closer to the actual counterfactual."

In fact, simple machine-learning donor selection methods can oftentimes give the same or similar answers to classical studies which oftentimes used covariates (in the original SCM paper, Abadie and his advisor used 13 covariates to construct the counterfactual, returning Cataluna and Madrid as the weighted donors). I say oftentimes because these results are predicated on both assumptions and tuning parameters. We assume, for example, some low rank approximation exists that can fit the pre-intervention time series of the treated unit. The tuning parameters matter too– the lambda parameters control the sparisty of our results, for example. I use a simple herustic to tune it, but it may be more reasonable to use methods such as cross-validation to select the number of clusters or the values lambda should take, but this would demand simulation evidence.\nEither way, the main benefit for policy analysts is that these two methods offer ways to select a donor poor for synthetic control methods, on top of not needing to collect auxilary covariates that the original paper used to obtain very similar counterfactual predictions, and more work should be done on these estimators to see when and why they’d agree."

In order to maximize our decision making capabilities, understanding the effects of these events we care about is critical so that businseses and governments may plan future business decisions better or know if a policy intervention achieves its intended aims. In absence of A/B tests (randomized controlled trials, which is quite popular amongst marketing firms/other areas of tech), business scientists and policy analysts frequently resort to constructing counterfactuals to infer treatment effecs. This is because conducting proper experiments is difficult, costly, and/or unethical, especially with most of the events we are concerned with which impact millions of people.\nDifference-in-Differences (DID) is one of the most popular methods for quasi-experimental designs/treatment effect analysis. DID is simple to compute, and is valid even in settings where we have one treated unit and a single control unit. The key identifying assumption of DID is parallel trends (PTA), or that the trend of the treated group would be constant with respect to the control group had a given intervention or policy never took place. Additionally, PTA posits no-anticipation of the intervention. Various restatements of PTA are common in the econometrics literature, especially under staggered adoption where DID is frequently applied to use cases researchers care about. However, sometimes DID is used even in settings of a single treated unit. And in these settings, PTA may be less likely to hold. This blog post goes over the Forward DID method with an application to the construction/tourism industry."

We can use these techniques to see how such laws/policies affect labor or safety. We can use causal inference to estimate the impact of events that are meant to affect the demand for tourism or other KPIs the tourism industry cares about. For construction, the physical building of construction units could be affected by these kind of policies, impacting metrics like put-in-place value or project stress indices. On the supply side, we may quantify the effects of policies such as tariffs on the costs of materials.

However, this can be challenging in settings with many potential controls, potentially many more control units than pre-treatment periods. Practically, researchers may wish to use this method when they have a high-dimensional donor pool and may be unsure as to which donors to include to reduce the impact of interpolation biases.

Both of these designs are available in mlsynth too, in the FDID class and PDA class with the method of fs (the default). The main difference here is that FDID can never overfit because it estimates only one parameter, whereas (in theory) FSCM and fsPDA can overfit if they end up including too many parameters in the regression model. Unclear how likely this is, since as we see below, teh FS method reduces the full donor pool to just under half of the originally selected donor units."

As ususal, in order to properly implement this, we begin by installing mlsynth from my Github\npip install -U git+https://github.com/jgreathouse9/mlsynth.git\nAnd then we load the Proposition 99 dataset and fit the model in the ususal mlsynth fashion. As per the ususal, we have a single unit name column which has the names of the donors, a time column (the year in this case), a numeric outcome column, and an indicator column which denotes the treatment when it is active and the unit is the name of the treated unit, else 0.\n\nimport pandas as pd # To work with panel data\n\nfrom IPython.display import display, Markdown # To create the table\n\nfrom mlsynth.mlsynth import FSCM # The method of interest\n\nurl = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jgreathouse9/mlsynth/refs/heads/main/basedata/smoking_data.csv\"\n\n# Feel free to change \"smoking\" with \"basque\" above in the URL\n\ndata = pd.read_csv(url)\n\n# Our method inputs\n\nconfig = {\n    \"df\": data,\n    \"outcome\": data.columns[2],\n    \"treat\": data.columns[-1],\n    \"unitid\": data.columns[0],\n    \"time\": data.columns[1],\n    \"display_graphs\": True,\n    \"save\": False,\n    \"counterfactual_color\": \"red\"}\n\narco = FSCM(config).fit()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter estimation, we can get the weights into a table like\n\nweights_dict = arco['Weights'][0]\ndf = pd.DataFrame(list(weights_dict.items()), columns=['State', 'Weight'])\ndisplay(Markdown(df.to_markdown(index=False)))\n\n\n\n\nState\nWeight\n\n\n\n\nMontana\n0.232\n\n\nAlabama\n-0\n\n\nColorado\n0.015\n\n\nConnecticut\n0.109\n\n\nGeorgia\n-0\n\n\nIdaho\n0\n\n\nIllinois\n0\n\n\nNevada\n0.205\n\n\nNew Hampshire\n0.045\n\n\nNew Mexico\n0\n\n\nNorth Carolina\n0\n\n\nNorth Dakota\n-0\n\n\nOklahoma\n-0\n\n\nUtah\n0.394\n\n\nVermont\n-0\n\n\nWest Virginia\n0\n\n\nWyoming\n0\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are the weights for all 17 units that were selected by the algorithm. As we can see, all of these even did not ultimately contribute to the SC, with only 6 being assigned positive weight. The ATT of Prop 99 as estimated by FSCM is -19.51 and the pre-treatment Root Mean Squared Error for FSCM is 1.66. I compared these results to the same results we get in Stata, which includes the covariates that Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmuller originally adjusted for as well as customizes the period over which to minimize the MSE. The ATT using the original method is -19.0018, and the RMSE for the pre-treatment period is 1.76. The corresponding weights using the full donor pool are 0.334 for Utah, 0.235 for Nevada, 0.2020 for Montana, Colorado 0.161, and Connecticut 0.068. So as we can see, the ATTs are very similar, and the pre-treatment prediction errors are pretty much the same. When we estimate this in Stata (omitting the auxilary covariate predictors and estimate synth2 cigsale cigsale(1988) cigsale(1980) cigsale(1975) , trunit(3) trperiod(1989) xperiod(1980(1)1988) nested fig, we get a RMSE of 4.33 and an ATT of -22.88. Furthermore, with this specification, the weights are no longer a sparse vector.\nThe point of this article is very simple. The original SCM works well, however it can be very sensitive to the inclusion of covariates, which covariates are included, what their lags are, and so on and so forth. Furthermore, there is also an issue of covariate selection in settings where we have multiple covariates that can potentially inform our selection of the donor pool. Furthermore, collecting a rich list of covariates may also not be possible in some settings. In such situations, especially without some pre-existing grount truth donor pool, analysts may apply the FSCM algorithm to guard against interpolation biases.\nAt least with the California example (and West Germany and Basque datasets, which I also tested), we can sometimes get comparable results to the baseline estimates which used multiple covariates for acceptable results (in all three of the standard test cases, FSCM actually get lower MSE than the original applications). In the Proposition 99 example, we select some of the same donor units, get a slightly better MSE and a very similar ATT without needing to fit to the covariates originally specified in the JASA paper.\nThe promise of machine-learning methods in this space is to automate away donor/predictor selection to some acceptable degree. The key thing of interest (for me, from an econometric theory perspective anyways) is which methods are best suited for this task, when do they perform well, and why. For example, it might be useful to derive bias bounds for this estimator to quantify how much the MSE should improve by compared to the original SCM and Forward DID, as has been done with clustering based methods, for example.\nA final caveat: in the original paper, Giovanni uses cross-validation to estimate this model, and he also employs the same covariates. I have not done the cross validation yet on my end, but I will very soon. As ususal, email me with questions or comments."

Note that how the file is defined within a driectory, which must be specified if the python file is not at the root (different ways of doing this).\n\n    - name: Run gas scraper\n      run: |\n        python \"City Scrape/cityscrape.py\"\n\nNext, I make the directory for the data if it does not exist.\n\n    - name: Ensure directory exists\n      run: |\n        mkdir -p \"City Scrape/Data/\"\n\nAnd finally, we commit the csv file my code creates to the directory at the repo. We use the Github Actions bot to do the commit. If there are no changes between any of the files before and after committing, we don’t add them and then the job ends (this is what happens if I try to run the action after it’s ran already that day). If not, the files are pushed. In my case, the files are named things like City_2025-01-31.csv. These files are staged, or prepared for being committed, with the addition of the commit message that I’m updating the data for that day. Then we push them to the directory of interest, and then job complete.\n    - name: Commit and push updated CSV to repository\n      run: |\n        git config --global user.name \"GitHub Actions\"\n        git config --global user.email \"github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com\"\n        \n        # Check if there are changes before committing\n        if git diff --quiet && git diff --staged --quiet; then\n          echo \"No changes detected, skipping commit.\"\n          exit 0\n        fi\n        \n        git add \"City Scrape/Data/City_*.csv\"\n        git commit -m \"Update gas prices data for $(date +'%Y-%m-%d')\"\n        git push https://x-access-token:${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}@github.com/${{ github.repository }}.git HEAD:main\n      env:\n        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n\nThe real value of this is not the data I’m scraping (unless you’re a fuel economist/policy scholar). The value is that this job runs independent of my will. I do not have to be at my computer for this to run. I do not need to worry about whether my computer has power or whether I’m home to personally oversee it. The value here is that I’ve manually gotten my computer to do a specific task every single day, the correct way (assuming you’ve coded everything right!!!), every time. Of course, this job is so insignificant such that I did not feel the need to run additional safechecks (say AAA’s site is down, I could have the action restart in 6 hours, or have it curl the website on the hour until it does respond), but obviously you can do plenty more here if the task matters enough. This is also a very partial list of what may be done. You can also place lots of parameters around your actions that may make life easier, or employ pre-commit hooks which can do checks for the quality of the code and other tasks before anything is committed, which will fail if they are not satisfied.\nAlso, it’s worth noting that Actions may run in conjunction with cloud computing for larger-scale jobs. So, if you’re a policy researcher, and your org uses Github but not using Actions for all kinds of process automation tasks, these provide a very useful tool to handle repetitive actions that free up your time to do other things. After all, a key benefit of script is to automate the boring stuff, provided that we’ve automated our tasks correctly."

    "text": "Plenty of posts have been done in the last decade on the synthetic control method and related approaches. It is a flavor of artificial counterfactual estimator for the panel data setting. Folks from Microsoft, Databricks, Uber, Amazon, Netflix, Gainwell Technologies, and elsewhere have written about/covered it, detailing its implementation, use cases, and econometric theory.\nMany (not all) of these cover the standard SCM, developed originally to study terrorism in the Basque Country and conduct comparative case studies more broadly. Standard SCM tends to favor, under certain technical conditions, a sparse set of control units being assigned weights. These weights aim to reconstruct the factor loadings/observed values of the treated unit, pre-intervention. Sparsity, or the true coefficient vector being mostly 0, has appealing properties; for example, a sparse vector allows us to interpret the synthetic control a lot easier, facilitating the estimation of leave-one-out placebos and other sensitivity checks. In some cases though, the sparsity notion is unfounded.\nThe the \\(\\ell_2\\) panel data approach is an econometric methodology developed by Zhentao Shi and Yishu Wang. The \\(\\ell_2\\)-PDA is a form of synthetic control estimation that accommodates sparse or dense data generation processes. A dense DGP is when the true vector of coefficients is mostly not zero. Sometimes, a sparse model is too simplistic, especially in settings where we have very many predictors. This is especially true when we have lots of multicollinearity among our predictors, which may be very plausible in settings with a lot of control units. The LASSO and the convex hull SCM (for different reasons and in different cases) generally struggle with this, whereas the Ridge or \\(\\ell_2\\)-PDA accomodate multicollinearity as a feature. In this post, I demonstrate the method as implemented in my library mlsynth. The Python code for these results may be found here."

    "text": "A Review of Synthetic Controls\nLet \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) denote the set of real numbers. Denote the natural numbers and unit interval respectively as \\[\n\\mathbb{N} \\coloneqq \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}, \\quad \\mathbb{I} \\coloneqq \\{ w \\in \\mathbb{R} : 0 \\leq w \\leq 1 \\}.\n\\] Let a caligraphic letter, say \\(\\mathcal A\\), denote a descrete set whose cardinality is \\(A=|\\mathcal{A}|\\). The sup norm of a vector \\(\\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^N\\) is defined as the maximum absolute value of its components, \\(\\|\\mathbf{y}\\|_\\infty = \\max_{j = 1, \\ldots, N} |y_j|\\). The floor function of a real number \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\), denoted as \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor\\), returns \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor = \\max \\{k \\in \\mathbb{N} : k \\leq x\\}\\). Let \\(t \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) and \\(i \\in \\mathbb{N}\\), represent the indices for \\(T\\) time periods and \\(N\\) units. The pre-treatment period consists of consecutive time periods \\(\\mathcal{T}_1 = \\{1, 2, \\ldots, T_0\\}\\) (cardinality \\(T_1\\)), while the post-treatment period is given by \\(\\mathcal{T}_2 = \\{T_0 + 1, \\ldots, T\\}\\) (cardinality \\(T_2\\)). The treated unit is indexed by \\(i = 1\\), while the remaining set of units, \\(\\mathcal{N}_0 \\coloneqq \\{2, \\ldots, N_0 + 1\\}\\) (cardinality \\(N_0\\)), forms the control group. Each outcome for all units is denoted by \\(y_{it}\\). Denote the outcome vector for the treated unit as \\(\\mathbf{y}_1 \\coloneqq \\begin{bmatrix} y_{11} & y_{12} & \\cdots & y_{1T} \\end{bmatrix}^\\top \\in \\mathbb{R}^T\\), where each entry corresponds to the outcome of the treated unit at time \\(t\\). The donor pool matrix, similarly, is defined as\n\\[\n\\mathbf{Y}_0 = \\begin{bmatrix}\n    y_{21} & y_{22} & \\cdots & y_{2T} \\\\\n    y_{31} & y_{32} & \\cdots & y_{3T} \\\\\n    \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n    y_{(N_0+1)1} & y_{(N_0+1)2} & \\cdots & y_{(N_0+1)T}\n  \\end{bmatrix} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N_0 \\times T}.\n\\]\nThe key challenge of causal inference is that we only observe the factual/realized outcome, expressed as:\n\\[\ny_{it} = y_{it}^1 d_{it} + \\left(1 - d_{it}\\right)y_{it}^0.\n\\] Outcomes in this framework are a function of treatment status, \\(d_{it} \\in \\{0, 1\\}\\). While \\(d_{it} = 1\\), a unit is treated and while \\(d_{it} = 0\\) a unit is untreated. Thus, \\(y_{it}^1\\) is the potential outcome under treatment, \\(y_{it}^0\\) is the counterfactual (or potential) outcome under no treatment. The objective is to estimate the counterfactual outcomes \\(y_{1t}^0\\). SCMs and panel data approaches are weighting based estimators. In this setup, some weight vector \\[\n\\mathbf{w} \\coloneqq \\begin{bmatrix} w_2 & w_3 & \\cdots & w_{N_0+1} \\end{bmatrix}^\\top, \\: \\text{where } w_i \\: \\forall \\: i \\in \\mathcal{N}_0.\n\\] is assigned across the \\(N_0\\) control units to approximate the treated unit’s pre-intervention outcome. SCM solves for \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) via the optimization:\n\\[\n\\underset{\\mathbf{w} \\in \\mathbb{I}^{N_0}}{\\operatorname*{argmin}} \\lVert \\mathbf{y}_1 - \\mathbf{w}^\\top \\mathbf{Y}_0 \\rVert_2^2,  \\: \\forall \\: t \\in \\mathcal{T}_{1}, \\: \\text{subject to } \\lVert \\mathbf{w} \\rVert_1 = 1.\n\\]\nHere, \\(\\mathbf{w}^\\top \\mathbf{Y}_0\\) represents the dot product of predictions, also known as a weighted average. The constraint of the convex hull disallows extrapolation of any form. SCMs are predicated on good pretreatment fit, such that \\(\\mathbf{w}^\\top \\mathbf{Y}_0 \\approx \\mathbf{y}_1\\). Speaking generally, the better pre-treatment fit we have over a long time series, the better the out-of-sample predictions will be for the synthetic control."

    "section": "Selecting \\(\\tau\\)",
    "text": "Selecting \\(\\tau\\)\nCritical to \\(\\ell_2\\)-PDA is the selection of tau. The reason for this is because while \\(\\tau \\to 0\\), the estimator converges to OLS, which we know will overfit to the pre-intervention data in most cases unless the data are exactly low-rank and fully observed. Too high a value of \\(\\tau\\) results in drastic underfitting (trust me) of the pre-treatment data. The way mlsynth tunes tau is by cross-validation over the pre-treatment period. mlsynth invokes a log-space over the interval \\(\\tau \\in \\left[ 10^{-4}, \\tau_{\\text{init}} \\right]\\), where \\(\\tau_{\\text{init}} = \\|\\boldsymbol{\\eta}\\|_\\infty\\). These correspond to the values of tau we supply. We first create a training and validation period, \\(\\mathcal{T}_1 = \\mathcal{T}_1^{\\text{train}} \\cup \\mathcal{T}_1^{\\text{val}}, \\quad\n\\mathcal{T}_1^{\\text{train}} \\cap \\mathcal{T}_1^{\\text{val}} = \\emptyset.\\) Denote the training series as \\(\\mathcal{T}_1^{\\text{train}} = \\{1, 2, \\ldots, k\\}\\). Denote the validation series as \\(\\mathcal{T}_1^{\\text{val}} = \\{k+1, \\ldots, T_0\\}\\), where \\(k = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{T_1}{2} \\right\\rfloor\\). We then estimate the model for the training period, and compute our predictions from \\(\\{k+1, \\ldots, T_0\\}\\). The tau we select is\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\tau^{\\ast} = \\operatorname*{argmin}_{\\tau} \\left( \\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{T}_1^{\\text{val}}|} \\| \\mathbf{y}^{\\ell_2} - \\mathbf{y}_1 \\|_2^2 \\right),\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nor the one that minimizes the validation Root Mean Squared Error. The performance is pretty close to what Zhentao and Yishu do for their empirical example (see the code at the documentation). In the original paper, they do a 70-30 train test split over the pre-intervention period, where they take the first 70% of the pre-treatment data and supply some values of tau.\nOkay hard part done. Let’s apply this to a real-life example, shall we?"
