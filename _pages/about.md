HiðŸ˜Š I'm Jared Amani Greathouse. Currently, I'm a public policy PHD candidate at Georgia State and the Georgia Institute of Technology, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Jason Coupet](https://aysps.gsu.edu/profile/jason-coupet/). Prior, I earned my Bachelors and Masters in political science from Georgia State University. I am the author of the [mlsynth](https://mlsynth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Python package, which implements various recent machine-learning and proximal causal inference techniques such as the [l2-relaxer](https://mlsynth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pda.html#ell-2-relaxation) or the [ [Bayesian] Robust Synthetic Control](https://mlsynth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/clustersc.html#pcr).

I am an econometrician specializing in causal inference, *particularly* with the synthetic control method and difference-in-differences. My current work focuses on high-dimensional data and machine learning methods for treatment effect estimation.  If causal inference is your thing, check out [the software I develop](https://jgreathouse9.github.io/software/) for Stata and Python. Check out my [blog](https://jgreathouse9.github.io/qdocs/index.html), "Policy Analysis, Data Science, and Causal Inference". Here I discuss causal inference, econometrics, and other data science topics for policy analysys. I am [also](https://www.statalist.org/forums/member/51320-jared-greathouse) an active contributor to the Statalist forum. [Here's my vita](http://jgreathouse9.github.io/files/VitaWeb.pdf). If you'd like to talk with me about my work, my consulting services, or anything else that's of interest, you may always reach out to me!

## News

- As of January 3, 2025, the alpha version of my Python package ```mlsynth``` [is operational](https://github.com/jgreathouse9/mlsynth#installing-mlsynth). The documentation is stil being [created](https://mlsynth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#), but tutorials exist for all but two classes.

- As of October 6th, 2024, [my draft](http://jgreathouse9.github.io/publications/Replication_of_Shi_2023.pdf) of an empirical replication is available, where I compare and contrast the findings of the Forward DID method versus [the fsPDA](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2021.04.009), using the Chinese Anti-Corruption Campaign as an example. [Here](https://github.com/jgreathouse9/RepACCFDID/tree/main) is the replication code.

- As of September 27th, my draft for the Forward DID method is avaliable. [Here](http://jgreathouse9.github.io/publications/FDIDSJ.pdf) is the link to read it. Note that it is has not been submitted for review yet. Any comments or feedback would be appreciated.
