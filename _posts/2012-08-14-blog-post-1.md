Plenty of posts have been done in the last decade on the synthetic control method and related approaches; folks from [Microsoft](https://medium.com/data-science-at-microsoft/causal-inference-using-synthetic-controls-d96a890c83a7), [Databricks](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-do-causal-inference-using-synthetic-controls-ab435e0228f1), [Uber](https://youtu.be/j5DoJV5S2Ao?si=RWUYFjFEWpvkl8x1), [Amazon](https://towardsdatascience.com/causal-inference-with-synthetic-control-in-python-4a79ee636325), [Netflix](https://netflixtechblog.com/round-2-a-survey-of-causal-inference-applications-at-netflix-fd78328ee0bb), and [else](https://rudrendupaul.medium.com/causal-inference-part-7-synthetic-control-methods-a-powerful-technique-for-inferring-causality-in-3ec5dbe26038)[where](https://henamsingla.medium.com/synthetic-control-method-a-z-d28099c56edb). Many (not of course [not all](https://peerunreviewed.blogspot.com/2019/11/a-short-tutorial-on-robust-synthetic.html)) of these go over the standard SCM, which broadly tends to favor, under certain condiions, a sparse set of control units being the underlying weights. And while sparsity has plenty of appealing properties, such as our ability to interpret the synthetic control, sometimes this advice simply breaks down because [sometimes](https://ceistorvergata.it/public/files/RFCS/Giannone_illusion4-2.pdf) the sparsity notion is wrong. In this post, I demonstrate the $\ell_2$ relaxer, an econometric methodology which accommodates dense data generation processes, or when the true vector of coefficient is mostly not zero.

```python
# Python example
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("World")
```


|   Column1 | Column2   |   Column3 |
|----------:|:----------|----------:|
|         1 | A         |       4.5 |
|         2 | B         |       5.6 |
|         3 | C         |       6.7 |


And now...
