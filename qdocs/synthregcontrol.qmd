# Notation

Let $\mathbb{R}$ denote the set of real numbers. A calligraphic letter, such as $\mathcal{S}$, represents a discrete set with cardinality $S = |\mathcal{S}|$. Let $\mathbf{C}_T \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times T}$ represent the centering matrix defined as:

$$
\mathbf{C}_T \coloneqq \mathbf{I}_T - \frac{1}{T} \mathbf{1}_T \mathbf{1}_T^\top
$$

Where $\mathbf{I}_T$ is the identity matrix of size $T$, and $\mathbf{1}_T \in \mathbb{R}^T$ is the vector of ones of length $T$.For any vector $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^T$, the demeaned version is:

$$
\widetilde{\mathbf{x}} \coloneqq \mathbf{C}_T \mathbf{x}
$$ 

Let $j \in \mathbb{N}$ represent indices for a total of $N$ units and $t \in \mathbb{N}$ index time. Let $j = 1$ be the treated unit, with the set of controls being $\mathcal{N}_0 = \mathcal{N} \setminus \{1\}$, with cardinality $N_0$. The pre-treatment period consists of the set $\mathcal{T}_1 = \{ t \in \mathbb{N} : t \leq T_0 \}$, where $T_0$ is the final period before treatment. Similarly, the post-treatment period is given by $\mathcal{T}_2 = \{ t \in \mathbb{N} : t > T_0 \}$. The observed outcome for unit $j$ at time $t$ is $y_{jt}$, where a generic outcome vector for a given unit in the dataset is $\mathbf{y}_j \in \mathbb{R}^T$, where $\mathbf{y}_j = (y_{j1}, y_{j2}, \dots, y_{jT})^\top \in \mathbb{R}^{T}$. The outcome vector for the treated unit specifically is $\mathbf{y}_1$. The donor matrix, similarly, is defined as $\mathbf{Y}_0 \coloneqq \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{y}_j \end{bmatrix}_{j \in \mathcal{N}_0} \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times N_0}$, where each column indexes a donor unit and each row is indexed to a time period.

## Synthetic Controls

Before I get to the SRC, I review synthetic controls. Let $\mathbf{y}_1 \in \mathbb{R}^T$ represent the outcome vector of the treated unit, where we seek to estimate the counterfactual outcomes in the post-treatment period (i.e., for $t > T_0$). We define the synthetic control as a weighted sum of the donor units' outcome vectors $\mathbf{y}_j$, where $j \in \mathcal{N}_0$. Specifically, we use a weight vector $\mathbf{w} \in \mathbb{R}^{N_0}$ to form the synthetic control, such that the counterfactual outcome for the treated unit is

$$
\mathbf{y}_1^{\text{SC}} = \mathbf{Y}_0 \mathbf{w}
$$

where $\mathbf{y}_1^{\text{SC}}$ is the predicted counterfactual outcome for the treated unit, $\mathbf{Y}_0 \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times N_0}$ is the matrix of outcome vectors for the donor units, and $\mathbf{w} \in \mathbb{R}^{N_0}$ is the vector of weights applied to each donor unit. The goal is to find $\mathbf{w}$ that best approximates the outcome vector of the treated unit during the pre-treatment period.

The weights are estimated by minimizing the distance between the treated unit's pre-treatment outcomes $\mathbf{y}_{1,\text{pre}}$ and the weighted average of the donor units' pre-treatment outcomes. This can be expressed as

$$
\min_{\mathbf{w}} \left\| \mathbf{y}_{1,\text{pre}} - \mathbf{Y}_{0,\text{pre}} \mathbf{w} \right\|_2^2
$$

where $\mathbf{y}_{1,\text{pre}} \in \mathbb{R}^{T_0}$ is the pre-treatment outcome vector for the treated unit and $\mathbf{Y}_{0,\text{pre}} \in \mathbb{R}^{T_0 \times N_0}$ is the pre-treatment outcome matrix for the donor units. The objective is to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) between the pre-treatment outcomes of the treated unit and the synthetic control.

$$
\mathcal{W} = \left\{ \mathbf{w} \in \mathbb{R}^{N_0} : \mathbf{w} \geq 0, \|\mathbf{w}\|_1 = 1 \right\}
$$

Once the weights $\mathbf{w}$ are estimated, the counterfactual outcome for the treated unit during the post-treatment period is given by

$$
\mathbf{y}_{1,t}^{\text{SC}} = \mathbf{Y}_0 \mathbf{w}, \quad \text{for } t > T_0
$$

Thus, the counterfactual outcome for each time period in the post-treatment period is the weighted sum of the donor units' outcomes, with the weights derived from the pre-treatment period.

# Synthetic Regression Control (SRC)

SRC is a penalized regression approach to synthetic control estimation. We first compute an in-sample projection of the treated unit onto the donor pool via an inverse-diagonal approximation. The demeaned outcome for the treated unit is then $\widetilde{\mathbf{y}}_1$ and the demeaned donor matrix is $\widetilde{\mathbf{Y}}_0$. This projection takes the form of a weighted sum

$$
\widehat{\mathbf{y}}_1 = \widetilde{\mathbf{Y}}_0 \left( \widetilde{\mathbf{Y}}_0^\top \widetilde{\mathbf{Y}}_0 \right)^{-1} \widetilde{\mathbf{Y}}_0^\top \widetilde{\mathbf{y}}_1,
$$

and serves to realign the donor units to resemble the target unit. We then use this projection to compute the residual variance between the target unit and the projection:

$$
\widehat{\sigma}^2 = \frac{1}{T_0} \left\| \widetilde{\mathbf{y}}_1 - \widehat{\mathbf{y}}_1 \right\|_2^2.
$$

This variance estimate captures how well the treated unit’s pre-treatment outcomes can be explained by the individual donor pool units. This adjusted variance statistic is used to solve for the donor pool weights. We solve for the donor weights by minimizing a penalized least squares criterion with an $\ell_1$ norm upon the donor weights

$$
\min_{\mathbf{w} \in \mathcal{W}} \quad \left\| \mathbf{y}_{1,\text{pre}} - \mathbf{Y}_{0,\text{pre}} \mathbf{w} \right\|_2 + 2 \widehat{\sigma}^2 \|\mathbf{w}\|_1. 
$$

After solving for the optimal weights, we compute the synthetic control’s counterfactual prediction over all $T$ periods. Because we demeaned our outcome earlier, we must re-mean our predictions

$$
\widehat{\mathbf{y}}_1 = \widetilde{\mathbf{Y}}_0 \mathbf{w} + \left( \frac{1}{T} \mathbf{1}_T^\top \mathbf{y}_1 - \frac{1}{T} \mathbf{1}_T^\top \mathbf{Y}_0 \mathbf{w} \right).
$$
