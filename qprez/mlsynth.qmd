## Why mlsynth?

- Counterfactual estimation is crucial for policy/business decisions.
- Existing methods have **serious limitations**:
  - LASSO struggles with multicollinearity.
  - Standard SCM lacks robustness in high-dimensional settings.
- **mlsynth** improves upon these issues.

## Problems with Existing Approaches

- **LASSO & SCM Issues**:
  - Overfitting and unstable counterfactual estimates.
  - Difficulty in high-dimensional datasets.
- **Need for better model averaging**:
  - Combining estimates improves accuracy.
  - Jensenâ€™s Inequality reduces RMSE.

## Benefits of mlsynth

- **Forward Difference-in-Differences (FDID)**
  - Better parallel trends
- **$\ell_2$ Relaxer**
  - Handles multicollinearity better than LASSO.
- **Robust PCA SCM**
  - Uses better PCA

## Example: FDID in Action

```{python results="markup"}
print("I am Jared")
```
