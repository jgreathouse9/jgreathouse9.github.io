# Introduction

Jared Amani Greathouse  
- PhD Candidate, Public Policy, Georgia State University

## A World Where Policy Cannot Be Avoided

- Pandemics are not individual-level events. Unlike epidemics which are more localized,

- Exposure is:
  - Non-optional
  - Non-local
  - (Generally) Non-isolable

- Outcomes depend heavily on:
  - Government action
  - Collective behavior
- COVID-19 forced policy decisions at massive scale

## The Central Policy Tension During COVID-19

- At the time, the debate (especially in the United States) was framed around a proposed tradeoff:

  - On one hand, lawmakers could mitigate public health risks by passing widespread policies to prevent viral spread

  - For example, large scale lockdowns such as the kind done in China were one option.


  - On the other hand, preserving economic and social well-being by not doing the above.

  - For example, it was planned to send out 600 million masks to American hoseholds, but [this was killed](https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/18/politics/postal-service-face-masks-coronavirus-trump-administration) by the White House to not cause panic.

## Non-pharmaceutical Interventions

- Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) aimed to:

  - Reduce transmission and health system strain via measures such as shelter in place mandates or closure of large scale events such as stadiums

- NPIs also imposed:
  - Employment and income losses
  - Tourism and service-sector disruptions
  - Broader economic consequences


## Current Literature

- Much existing econometric literature on the effect of COVID policy emphasizes health impacts (e.g., case growth, hospitalizations) and whether NPIs mitigated the spread of the virus.

- For example, researchers [studied](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2114226119) how opening of NFL stadiums impacted the spread of the virus or how [earlier lockdowns](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00072) affected case rates in hte United States.

- Far less is known about secondary outcomes:

  - Economic activity, labor markets, environmental outcomes

- A key question remains then:  
  *Can policies protect public health without causing large economic or other social harms?*

## Why Identification Is Hard

- Pandemics create a latent, system-wide "background treatment":
  - All units are exposed in some way
  - Policies respond to this background risk
  - Spillovers and network effects are pervasive

- Implications for evaluation:
  - SUTVA is often violated
  - Untreated control units are hard to identify
  - Standard DiD or SCM approaches can fail
- Observed outcomes may conflate policy effects with the underlying pandemic shock

## Implications for Policy Analysis

- If standard econometric techniques cannot provide satisfactory answers to these problems, this limits our ability to measure the broader impact of COVID policy

- If we have limited knowledge of this, then we stand less prepared for future pandemics.

## Role of Machine Learning

- Enhances counterfactual estimation by:
  - Flexibly modeling complex dynamics (such as, low rank matrix estimation to denoise outcome data)
  - Selecting relevant control groups via formalized algorithms such as k-means or the $\ell_1$ norm for variable selection
  - Mitigating spillover effects using proximal causal inference methods

## Technical Motivation

- However, many modern causal inference methods lack ready-to-use software

- Existing SCM tools in R, Stata:
  - Can be very limited in scope
  - Cannot easily implement or extend novel identification strategies
  - Are not free.

- To address this gap, [I developed](https://mlsynth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) **`mlsynth`** (machine learning synthetic control), an open-source Python package

- `mlsynth` allows analysts to use modern machine learning tools from the synthetic control literature to address spillover effects, mitigate the arbitrarity of donor pool selection, and perform annalysis when no donors are present.

## Paper 1: Hawaii’s COVID-19 Quarantine

**Question:**  
What were the economic costs of Hawaii’s March 2020 mandatory quarantine?

**Method:**  
Synthetic Historical Control (SHC)

**Outcomes:**  
- Tourism demand  
- Labor market conditions  
- Statewide economic activity


## Why Hawaii?

- Most extreme U.S. COVID containment policy, more so than any other state in the country
- Introduced a mandatory 14-day quarantine on *all* arrivals (March 26, 2020) until September 2020
- *Effectively* sealed borders and shut down tourism
- No comparable U.S. state intervention


## Core Policy Question

**What are the economic costs of decisive early action under uncertainty?**

- Early containment may prevent long-run damage

- A key question is the degree to which the intervention impacted the economy, in contrast to places like Florida who did not such restrictions.

## Difficulty in studying this case

- Hawaii is:

  - Geographically isolated

  - Highly tourism-dependent, making it economically distinct from most states

- Furthermore, because not every state collects tourism data, no credible untreated comparison units

- Standard DiD and SCM designs will fail

## Methodological Solution

**Synthetic Historical Control (SHC)**

- Uses the treated unit’s *own past*
- Constructs counterfactuals from historical segments
- Requires no geographic control units
- Designed for:
  - One-off shocks
  - System-wide interventions

## SHC Intuition

- Match the *last pre-treatment window*
- Using weighted combinations of:
  - Earlier historical segments where intervention was not active.
- Learn how Hawaii typically evolves, absent either pandemic or lockdown
- Extrapolate forward absent treatment

## Economic Outcomes

**Tourism Demand**

- Visitor Days

- Hotel Occupancy

All measured as:
- Annualized year-over-year growth rates

## Data

- Monthly time series
- 30 years of pre-treatment data (1990 to 2020).
- Sources:
  - Hawaii Department of Business Economic Developmemt and Tourism
- Treatment begins: March 2020

## Inference

- Placebo tests in time
- Conformal prediction intervals
- Distribution-free
- 90% out-of-sample coverage

## Contribution

- First causal estimate of Hawaii’s quarantine effects
- Demonstrates SHC in an extreme policy setting
- Provides evidence on economic costs of near-zero-COVID policies
- Broad relevance for crisis policymaking


## Paper 2: Impact of National Lockdown on Air Quality in India

## The COVID-19 Lockdown

- On March 25, 2020, India began a strict lockdown to combat the spread of COVID-19.
- Among the strictest globally  
- Sudden halt to:
  - Transportation  
  - Industrial activity  
  - Construction  
- While the first order indicator is spread of the virus, there was also a large carbon emissions shock

## Motivation

- Air pollution is one of India’s most severe public health challenges  
- Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is the primary pollutant of concern  
- Chronic exposure affects over 1.4 billion people  
- Persistent exceedance of WHO and national standards


## Sources of PM2.5 in India

- Vehicular emissions  
- Industrial production  
- Construction activity  
- Biomass burning (household and agricultural)  
- Seasonal and meteorological factors


## Severity and Spatial Variation

- National average PM2.5 far exceeds WHO guidelines  
- Large regional heterogeneity:
  - Indo-Gangetic Plain: extreme winter pollution  
  - Major metros consistently among the world’s most polluted (especially Delhi).
- Pollution is persistent, not episodic


## Health Impacts

- Long-term exposure increases:
  - Cardiovascular disease  
  - Respiratory illness  
  - Stroke and lung cancer  
- Air pollution causes ~1.5 million premature deaths annually  
- Substantial reductions in life expectancy, especially in Delhi

## Economic Impacts

- Significant healthcare expenditures  
- Reduced labor productivity  
- Losses in tourism and agriculture  
- Estimated costs ≈ 1–1.5% of GDP annually  
- Policy response: National Clean Air Programme (NCAP)

## Lockdown as a Natural Experiment

- Policy applied uniformly across the country  
- Sharp timing and clear intervention onset  
- A rare opportunity to study large-scale emissions reductions  
- Particularly relevant for national-level air quality


## Observed Changes During Lockdown

- PM2.5 declined sharply across monitored locations  
- Reductions often in the range of 30–50%  
- Major metros experienced large AQI improvements  
- Effects strongest in early lockdown phases

## What Existing Studies Show

- Consistent evidence of pollution declines during lockdowns  
- Findings documented across:
  - India  
  - China  
  - Europe  
- Effects observed for PM2.5, NO₂, and PM10


## Dominant Empirical Approaches

- Pre–post comparisons  
- Year-over-year comparisons  
- Graphical trend analysis  
- Satellite imagery  
- Simple regression models


## Limits of Existing Evidence

- Largely descriptive  
- No explicit counterfactual construction  
- Confounding from seasonality and weather  
- Limited policy relevance


## Causal Approaches in the Literature

- Interrupted Time Series (ITS)  
- Synthetic Control and augmented SCM  
- Causal machine learning methods  
- Mixed findings across contexts


## Methodological Gap

- Few credible causal designs for national-scale interventions  
- Makes the SHC method a natural candidate

## Data

- *Source:* SHRUG – Socioeconomic High-resolution Rural-Urban Geographic Data Platform for India
- *Spatial coverage:* 635 districts across India  
- *Temporal coverage:* Jan 1998 – Dec 2020 (monthly observations)  
- *Outcome:* PM2.5 concentrations, population-weighted at district level  

**National-level analysis:**
- Population-weighted average across all districts → single monthly time series

*Treated districts (city-level analysis):*
- Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Kolkata (major tech hubs/metropolitan areas).
- Aggregated subdistricts to district-level averages

## Data Transformation

- Compute year-over-year (YoY) growth rates of PM2.5:  

  - Compares each month to same month in previous year

- Final outcome series for analysis:  
  - **National:** YoY growth of PM2.5 across India  
  - **Cities:** YoY growth for each treated district  

- Restricts analysis to 1999–2020, months 13–312 of the dataset

## Contribution of This Chapter

- First causal evaluation of India’s nationwide lockdown on PM2.5.
- If successful, illustrates how government action like this can significantly mitigate emissions in the short term.

## Paper 3: Locking Away Prosperity? Evaluating the Labor Impacts of Vaccine Mandates


## Motivation

- COVID-19 NPIs initially focused on lockdowns and masks  
- Early research emphasized timing and public health benefits  
- Subsequent work documented economic and labor market costs  
- Less is known about later-stage pandemic policies

- One key policy passed by many jurisdictions was the idea of vaccine passports/mandates.


## From Lockdowns to Mandates

- Vaccines became widely available by early 2021  
- Policymakers sought alternatives to broad lockdowns  
- Vaccine mandates emerged as a targeted intervention  
- Goal: protect public health while sustaining economic activity


## Why Focus on Restaurants?

- High-contact, indoor settings  
- Central to urban leisure economies  
- Sensitive to both consumer confidence and labor supply  
- A leading concern during mandate debates


## Policy Question

- How did city-level vaccine mandates affect restaurant employment?

- New York City (August 2021)
- San Francisco (August 2021)
- New Orleans (August 2021)
- Los Angeles (November 2021)

Each implemented strict vaccine mandates for indoor dining and other public venues in 2021. Other cities (i.e., [Chicago](https://ogletree.com/insights-resources/blog-posts/chicago-issues-proof-of-covid-19-vaccination-requirement-for-restaurants-gyms-and-indoor-concerts/)) did too, but they did so when a new COVID variant (Omicron) became viral, a critical confounder for identification.

## Why These Cities Matter

- Large, economically important metros  
- Early adopters of vaccine mandates  
- Clear policy onsets and enforcement timelines  
- Urban outliers in the national policy landscape

## Expected Employment Channels

- Supply side:
  - Worker compliance or exit  
  - Staffing frictions  
- Demand side:
  - Consumer confidence  
  - Willingness to dine indoors  

Net effects are theoretically ambiguous. Whatever the theoretical relationship, the question that remains unanswered is the degree to which these mandates affected employment.


## Contribution of This Chapter

- First causal analysis of vaccine mandates on restaurant employment  
- Focuses on labor market outcomes
- Evaluates mandates as an economic policy tool

## Empirical Strategy

- Compare treated cities to synthetic counterfactuals, using staggered adoption SCM methods
- Use MSAs without similar mandates as donors  
- Focus on year-over-year employment growth  
- Separate analysis by city

## Data

- Monthly MSA-level employment data  
- Source: BLS / FRED  
- Time span: 1991–2022  
- Outcome:
  - Full-service restaurant employment 
  - Leisure and hospitality employment
  - Both as Year on Year Growth rates


## What this Dissertation Adds

- Pandemic policy is, in principle, a joint health–economic decision problem
  - Governments do not choose policies based on epidemiological outcomes alone
  - Economic consequences shape political feasibility, compliance, and long-run welfare

- While health effects may be transient, economic impacts can persist even after the virus goes away
  - Industry contraction
  - Labor market scarring
  - Changes in regional economic structure

- Outcomes studied in this dissertation capture these longer-run margins:
  - Tourism: regional exposure to mobility and border restrictions
  - Restaurant employment: labor market recovery in high-contact sectors
  - Air pollution: economic activity and mobility responses beyond reported statistics

- Credible counterfactuals for these outcomes allow policymakers to:
  - Assess short-run costs versus long-run consequences
  - Distinguish temporary disruptions from lasting damage
  - Evaluate whether decisive action under uncertainty pays off

- Substantively, this work helps answer:
  > *Can non-pharmaceutical interventions protect public health without imposing persistent economic harm?*
