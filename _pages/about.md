HiðŸ˜Š I'm Jared Amani Greathouse. Currently, I'm a public policy PHD candidate at Georgia State and the Georgia Institute of Technology, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Jason Coupet](https://aysps.gsu.edu/profile/jason-coupet/). Prior, I earned my Bachelors and Masters in political science from Gerogia State University.

 I am an econometrician specializing in causal inference, *particularly* with the synthetic control method and difference-in-differences.  If causal inference is your thing, check out [the software I develop](https://jgreathouse9.github.io/software/) for Stata and Python. I am [also](https://www.statalist.org/forums/member/51320-jared-greathouse) an active contributor to the Statalist forum. [Here's my vita](http://jgreathouse9.github.io/files/VitaWeb.pdf). If you'd like to talk with me about my work, my consulting services, or anything else that's of interest, you may always reach out to me!

## News

- As of October 6th, 2024, [my draft](http://jgreathouse9.github.io/publications/Replication_of_Shi_2023.pdf) of an empirical replication is available, where I compare and contrast the findings of the Forward DID method versus [the fsPDA](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2021.04.009), using the Chinese Anti-Corruption Campaign as an example.

- As of September 27th, my draft for the Forward DID method is avaliable. [Here](http://jgreathouse9.github.io/publications/FDIDSJ.pdf) is the link to read it. Note that it is has not been submitted for review yet. Any comments or feedback would be appreciated.


- As of 7/12/2024, I've [created](https://github.com/jgreathouse9/FDIDTutorial/blob/main/StataVignette.md) the ```fdid``` command for Stata, implementing the Forward DID method in Stata. I link to the vignette where users may see how the syntax works.
- As of 5/24/2024, I've [updated](https://github.com/jgreathouse9/mlsynth/blob/main/Vignettes/RPCA/RPCAVignette.md) ```mlsynth``` to include the tutorial for [Robust PCA SCM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12542).
