# Introduction

**Jared Amani Greathouse**  
- PhD Candidate, Public Policy, Georgia State University  
- Advisor: Jason Coupet  
- Specialization: Econometrics and Causal Inference  
- Focus: Synthetic Control Methods, High-Dimensional Panel Data, Machine Learning for Treatment Effects  


## My Work

- Developed mlsynth, the largest Python SCM package to date  
- Suite of tools for policy evaluation using panel data  
- Supports dozens of estimators: vanilla SCM, cluster SCM, factor models, PDA, proximal SCM, and more  
- Handles complex, high-dimensional causal inference settings  

## What Makes MLSYNTH Special

- Consolidates decades of non-experimental SCM and panel methods from multiple software ecosystems into Python with one singular syntax
- Easy installation, automation, and scaling  
- Supports a broad set of estimators for diverse research questions  
- **MAREX:** Market Experiment Design feature for selecting treated and control units under constraints  
- Decision-making tool: Explore multiple scenarios with penalties, clusters, costs, budgetsâ€”overnight simulations possible  

## Market Experiment Design with MAREX

- Based on **Abadie & Zhao (2025)**  
- Python implementation allows:  
  - Treated and control selection simultaneously  
  - Enforces cluster, budget, cardinality constraints 
  - Penalizes units far from cluster means for representativeness  
- Treats synthetic control as a decision-making tool, not just estimation
