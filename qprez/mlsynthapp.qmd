## üëã Welcome

- *The MLSYNTH App* = point-and-click interface for causal inference  

- Wraps my [`mlsynth`](https://github.com/jgreathouse9/mlsynth) Python package  

- Designed for:
  - Policy analysts
  - Economists
  - Business owners
  - Data scientists  

---

## Motivation

- Policy evaluation needs credible counterfactuals  

- Synthetic control (SCM) provides a flexible framework, especially when the parallel trends assumption of DID does not hold.

- But today:
  - Fragmented implementations of different SCMs exist
  - Steep learning curve for different implementations of SCM
  - Not all researchers know R or Python, where many of these developments live

---

## Why Use the MLSYNTH App?

What are you really getting when you use the MLSYNTH App?

**Convenience.**

---

## The Problem

1. **Many papers are hard to digest**

   - Some take days of rereading (e.g. *On Robustness of Principal Component Regression Anish Agarwal,Devavrat Shah,Dennis Shen & Dogyoon Song, 1731-1745*)

   - Even relatively more straightforward ones (e.g. *Li, Kathleen T. (2023). ‚ÄúFrontiers: A Simple Forward Difference-in-Differences Method.‚Äù Marketing Science 43(2):267-279.* ) demand hours to read.

2. **Code is fragmented**

   - Some estimators exist only in replication files or are in fragile, unpackaged R/Python scripts

   -  Some may be tied to Stata or MATLAB (paid software)

## Time Costs

Rough estimates of time saved by MLSYNTH:  

| Estimator   | Hours to Learn + Code | MLSYNTH Time |
|-------------|------------------------|---------------|
| FDID        | ~40                    | Minutes |
| FSCM        | ~75                    | Minutes |
| RPCA        | ~90                    | Minutes |
| SI          | ~110                   | Minutes |

---

## Who Suffers Most?

- Even trained researchers spend *dozens of hours* per estimator in the time that it takes to code and understand it.

- For the average policy analyst or master‚Äôs student:  

  - Multiply those hours by 2‚Äì4

  - Steep learning curve which demands solid stats, math, code, causal inference background  

**MLSYNTH App = simplifies this process.**

---

## Two Ways to Pay

1. **Pay in Time**  

   - Learn Python and read the papers

   - Use `mlsynth` source code directly  

2. **Pay in Money**  

   - Use the app  

   - Skip the coding, focus on analysis  

Either way, with the mlsynth app, you never pay in both.  

---

## How It Works

1. Upload a panel dataset (unit, time, outcome, treatment)  

2. Choose an estimator  

3. Run the model ‚Üí results visualized automatically  

4. Download outputs for further analysis  

---

## Sample Datasets

- **California Tobacco Law (1988)** ‚Üí Cigarette sales  
- **German Reunification (1990)** ‚Üí GDP  
- **Basque Terrorism (1975)** ‚Üí GDP per capita  
- **Hubei Lockdown (2020)** ‚Üí GDP growth  
- **Hong Kong Integration (2003)** ‚Üí GDP  

---

## Available Estimators

- **FDID**: Forward Difference-in-Differences  
- **FSCM**: Forward-Selected Synthetic Control  
- **CLUSTERSC**: Cluster SCM (PCR, RPCA)  
- **SRC**: Synthetic Regression Control  
- **PDA**: Panel Data Approaches
- **FMA**: Factor Model Approach  
- **NSC**: Nonlinear SCM  
- **SI**: Synthetic Interventions

## Coming Soon

- Robustness checks (placebo tests)

## A Word of Caution

- MLSYNTH ‚â† black box  
- Estimators rely on assumptions  
- Misuse ‚Üí misleading results  

Use MLSYNTH to **save coding time** ‚Äî but rely on econometric intuition.
