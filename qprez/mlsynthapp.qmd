## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

- *The MLSYNTH App* = point-and-click interface for causal inference  
- Wraps my [`mlsynth`](https://github.com/jgreathouse9/mlsynth) Python package  
- Designed for:
  - Policy analysts
  - Economists
  - Business owners
  - Data scientists  

---

## Motivation

- Policy evaluation needs credible counterfactuals  
- Synthetic control (SCM) provides a flexible framework  
- But today:
  - Fragmented implementations
  - Steep learning curve
  - Reproducibility challenges  

---

## Why Use the MLSYNTH App?

What are you really getting when you use MLSYNTH?

**Convenience.**

---

## The Problem

1. **Papers are hard to digest**
   - Some take days of rereading (e.g. PCR, RPCA)
   - Even straightforward ones (e.g. FDID) demand hours

2. **Code is fragmented**
   - Some estimators exist only in replication files
   - Others are in fragile, unpackaged R/Python scripts
   - Often tied to Stata or MATLAB (paid software)

---

## Time Costs

Rough estimates of time saved by MLSYNTH:  

| Estimator   | Hours to Learn + Code | MLSYNTH Time |
|-------------|------------------------|---------------|
| FDID        | ~40                    | Minutes |
| FSCM        | ~75                    | Minutes |
| RPCA        | ~90                    | Minutes |
| SI          | ~110                   | Minutes |

---

## Who Suffers Most?

- Even trained researchers spend *dozens of hours* per estimator  
- For the average policy analyst or masterâ€™s student:  
  - Multiply those hours by 2â€“4Ã—  
  - Steep learning curve across stats, math, code, causal inference  

**MLSYNTH = a lifeline for non-technical users.**

---

## Two Ways to Pay

1. **Pay in Time**  
   - Learn Python + read the papers  
   - Use `mlsynth` source code directly  

2. **Pay in Money**  
   - Use the app  
   - Skip the coding, focus on insights  

Either way â†’ you donâ€™t pay in both.  

---

## How It Works

1. Upload a panel dataset (unit, time, outcome, treatment)  
2. Choose an estimator  
3. Run the model â†’ results visualized automatically  
4. Download outputs for further analysis  

---

## Sample Datasets

- **California Tobacco Law (1988)** â†’ Cigarette sales  
- **German Reunification (1990)** â†’ GDP  
- **Basque Terrorism (1975)** â†’ GDP per capita  
- **Hubei Lockdown (2020)** â†’ GDP growth  
- **Hong Kong Integration (2003)** â†’ GDP  

Each dataset is a *classic* case in SCM literature.  

---

## Available Estimators

- **FDID**: Forward Difference-in-Differences  
- **FSCM**: Forward-Selected Synthetic Control  
- **CLUSTERSC**: Cluster donor pools (PCR, RPCA)  
- **SRC**: Synthetic Regression Control  
- **PDA**: Forward Selection / L2 / LASSO  
- **FMA**: Factor Model Approach  
- **NSC**: Nonlinear SCM  
- **SI**: Synthetic Interventions  

---

## Coming Soon

- Additional estimators (SCMO, SDID)  
- Robustness checks (placebo tests)  
- Interactive tutorials

## A Word of Caution

- MLSYNTH â‰  black box  
- Estimators rely on assumptions  
- Misuse â†’ misleading results  

Use MLSYNTH to **save coding time** â€” but rely on econometric intuition.
