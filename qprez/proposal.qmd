# Introduction

## A World Where Policy Cannot Be Avoided

- Pandemics are not individual-level risks
- Exposure is:
  - Non-optional
  - Non-local
  - (Generally) Non-isolable

- Outcomes depend heavily on:
  - Government action
  - Collective behavior

- COVID-19 forced policy decisions at massive scale

## Why Study COVID-19 Policy?

- Pandemics differ fundamentally from most policy contexts
- COVID-19 was a global shock, not a localized intervention
- Nearly all regions were affected simultaneously
- Individual mitigation is limited:
  - Outcomes depend heavily on public policy and government action

- COVID-19 policies provide a uniquely important setting for causal analysis

## Pandemics as a Policy Environment

- Pandemic response policies are:
  - Rapidly deployed
  - High-stakes
  - Implemented under deep uncertainty

- Governments must act despite:
  - Limited prior evidence
  - Evolving scientific knowledge
  - Tradeoffs between health and economic outcomes

- Understanding these policies requires generating credible counterfactuals

## Why Identification Is Especially Hard in Pandemics

- Pandemics generate system-wide shocks
- Economic, social, and behavioral responses are tightly intertwined
- Effects propagate through:
  - Travel networks
  - Supply chains
  - Information and expectations

- These dynamics generate pervasive spillovers across units

## Why Controls Fail Under Spillovers

- Events in one location affect outcomes elsewhere:
  - Mobility restrictions
  - Border controls
  - National or global behavioral responses

- As a result:
  - Geographic controls are contaminated
  - Timing differences do not imply lack of exposure
  - Non-geographic controls reflect the same underlying shock

- No unit is plausibly unaffected

## Ubiquitous Exposure as the Core Identification Problem

- In global shocks:
  - All units are partially treated
  - "Control" becomes a misnomer
  - Exposure varies in degree, not kind

- This violates the central identifying assumption:

  > *Controls must be unaffected by treatment*

- Identification failure is structural, not methodological

## Implications for Policy Analysis

- As a result:
  - Traditional evaluation strategies which rely in contemporaneously unaffected units struggle to isolate policy impacts

- For policy studies, this creates fundamental difficulties:
  - Assessing effectiveness under conditions of universal exposure
  - Distinguishing policy-driven changes from collective behavioral responses
  - Translating empirical findings into actionable guidance for decision-makers

- Credible policy analysis in these settings requires:
  - Careful construction of counterfactuals
  - Methods that (can) explicitly account for spillovers and shared shocks

## Role of Machine Learning

- Machine learning enhances historical counterfactuals by:
  - Flexibly modeling complex dynamics
  - Selecting relevant historical segments
  - Improving predictive accuracy

- ML-augmented methods allow:
  - Counterfactual construction without untreated units
  - Credible inference under system-wide interventions

- These tools are essential for pandemic-era policy evaluation

## Technical Motivation

- Many modern causal inference methods lack ready-to-use software

- Existing SCM tools in R, Stata, and Python:
  - Are very limited in scope
  - Cannot implement novel identification strategies easily.

- To address this gap, I developed **`mlsynth`**, an open-source Python package

**`mlsynth` enables:**

- Synthetic control and panel data methods in a flexible framework
- Machine learning tools to address spillovers, high-dimensional donor pools, and SUTVA violations


## Paper 1: Hawaii’s COVID-19 Quarantine

**Question:**  
What were the short-run economic costs of Hawaii’s March 2020 mandatory quarantine?

**Method:**  
Synthetic Historical Control (SHC)

**Outcomes:**  
- Tourism demand  
- Labor market conditions  
- Statewide economic activity


## Why Hawaii?

- Most extreme U.S. COVID containment policy
- Introduced a mandatory 14-day quarantine on *all* arrivals (March 26, 2020)
- Effectively sealed borders and shut down tourism
- No comparable U.S. state intervention


## Core Policy Question

**What are the economic costs of decisive early action under uncertainty?**

- Early containment may prevent long-run damage
- But imposes large short-run economic losses
- Critical for future crises:
  - Pandemics
  - Climate shocks
  - Geopolitical disruptions

- A key question is the degree to which the intervention impacted the economy, in contrast to places like Florida who did not such restrictions.

## Difficulty in studying this case

- Hawaii is:

  - Geographically isolated

  - Highly tourism-dependent

  - Economically distinct

- No credible untreated comparison units, meaning standard DiD and SCM designs fail



## The Identification Problem

- COVID-19 is a *global* shock
- Nearly all regions experienced treatment
- No clean donor pool of nations of even other economic metrics exist
- Cross-sectional comparisons break down


## Methodological Solution

**Synthetic Historical Control (SHC)**

- Uses the treated unit’s *own past*
- Constructs counterfactuals from historical segments
- Requires no geographic control units
- Designed for:
  - One-off shocks
  - System-wide interventions



## SHC Intuition

- Match the *last pre-treatment window*
- Using weighted combinations of:
  - Earlier historical segments where intervention was not active.
- Learn how Hawaii typically evolves, absent either pandemic or lockdown
- Extrapolate forward absent treatment


## Economic Outcomes

**Tourism Demand**
- Visitor Days
- Hotel Occupancy

All measured as:
- Annualized year-over-year growth rates


## Data

- Monthly time series
- 30 years of pre-treatment data (1990 to 2020).
- Sources:
  - Hawaii Department of Business Economic Developmemt and Tourism
- Treatment begins: March 2020

## Empirical Design

1. Smooth pre-treatment series
2. Construct historical donor segments (of length 60, or 5 years)
3. Match evaluation window (5 years before the policy intervention)
4. Predict post-treatment counterfactual, under no lockdown
5. Compare observed outcomes to predictions

## Inference

- Placebo tests in time
- Conformal prediction intervals
- Distribution-free
- 90% out-of-sample coverage

## Contribution

- First causal estimate of Hawaii’s quarantine effects
- Demonstrates SHC in an extreme policy setting
- Provides evidence on economic costs of near-zero-COVID policies
- Broad relevance for crisis policymaking


## Paper 2: Impact of National Lockdown on Air Quality in India

## The COVID-19 Lockdown

- On March 25, 2020, India began a strict lockdown to combat the spread of COVID-19.
- Among the strictest globally  
- Sudden halt to:
  - Transportation  
  - Industrial activity  
  - Construction  
- While the first order indicator is spread of the virus, there was also a large carbon emissions shock

## Motivation

- Air pollution is one of India’s most severe public health challenges  
- Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is the primary pollutant of concern  
- Chronic exposure affects over 1.4 billion people  
- Persistent exceedance of WHO and national standards


## Sources of PM2.5 in India

- Vehicular emissions  
- Industrial production  
- Construction activity  
- Biomass burning (household and agricultural)  
- Seasonal and meteorological factors


## Severity and Spatial Variation

- National average PM2.5 far exceeds WHO guidelines  
- Large regional heterogeneity:
  - Indo-Gangetic Plain: extreme winter pollution  
  - Major metros consistently among the world’s most polluted  
- Pollution is persistent, not episodic


## Health Impacts

- Long-term exposure increases:
  - Cardiovascular disease  
  - Respiratory illness  
  - Stroke and lung cancer  
- Air pollution causes ~1.5 million premature deaths annually  
- Substantial reductions in life expectancy, especially in Delhi

## Economic Impacts

- Significant healthcare expenditures  
- Reduced labor productivity  
- Losses in tourism and agriculture  
- Estimated costs ≈ 1–1.5% of GDP annually  
- Policy response: National Clean Air Programme (NCAP)

## Lockdown as a Natural Experiment

- Policy applied uniformly across the country  
- Sharp timing and clear intervention onset  
- A rare opportunity to study large-scale emissions reductions  
- Particularly relevant for national-level air quality


## Observed Changes During Lockdown

- PM2.5 declined sharply across monitored locations  
- Reductions often in the range of 30–50%  
- Major metros experienced large AQI improvements  
- Effects strongest in early lockdown phases

## What Existing Studies Show

- Consistent evidence of pollution declines during lockdowns  
- Findings documented across:
  - India  
  - China  
  - Europe  
- Effects observed for PM2.5, NO₂, and PM10


## Dominant Empirical Approaches

- Pre–post comparisons  
- Year-over-year comparisons  
- Graphical trend analysis  
- Satellite imagery  
- Simple regression models


## Limits of Existing Evidence

- Largely descriptive  
- No explicit counterfactual construction  
- Confounding from seasonality and weather  
- Limited policy relevance


## Causal Approaches in the Literature

- Interrupted Time Series (ITS)  
- Synthetic Control and augmented SCM  
- Causal machine learning methods  
- Mixed findings across contexts


## Methodological Gap

- Few credible causal designs for national-scale interventions  
- Makes the SHC method a natural candidate

## Data

- *Source:* SHRUG – Socioeconomic High-resolution Rural-Urban Geographic Data Platform for India
- *Spatial coverage:* 635 districts across India  
- *Temporal coverage:* Jan 1998 – Dec 2020 (monthly observations)  
- *Outcome:* PM2.5 concentrations, population-weighted at district level  

**National-level analysis:**
- Population-weighted average across all districts → single monthly time series

*Treated districts (city-level analysis):*
- Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Kolkata (major tech hubs/metropolitan areas).
- Aggregated subdistricts to district-level averages

## Data Transformation

- Compute year-over-year (YoY) growth rates of PM2.5:  

  - Compares each month to same month in previous year

- Final outcome series for analysis:  
  - **National:** YoY growth of PM2.5 across India  
  - **Cities:** YoY growth for each treated district  

- Restricts analysis to 1999–2020, months 13–312 of the dataset



## Contribution of This Chapter

- First causal evaluation of India’s nationwide lockdown on PM2.5.
- If successful, illustrates how government action like this can significantly mitigate emissions in the short term.

## Paper 3: Locking Away Prosperity? Evaluating the Labor Impacts of Vaccine Mandates


## Motivation

- COVID-19 NPIs initially focused on lockdowns and masks  
- Early research emphasized timing and public health benefits  
- Subsequent work documented economic and labor market costs  
- Less is known about later-stage pandemic policies


## From Lockdowns to Mandates

- Vaccines became widely available by early 2021  
- Policymakers sought alternatives to broad lockdowns  
- Vaccine mandates emerged as a targeted intervention  
- Goal: protect public health while sustaining economic activity


## Why Focus on Restaurants?

- High-contact, indoor settings  
- Central to urban leisure economies  
- Sensitive to both consumer confidence and labor supply  
- A leading concern during mandate debates


## Policy Question

How did city-level vaccine mandates affect restaurant employment?

- Did mandates slow employment recovery?  
- Or did they support demand by improving perceived safety?  
- Are effects consistent across cities?


## Treated Cities

- New York City  
- San Francisco  
- New Orleans  
- Los Angeles  

Each implemented vaccine mandates for indoor dining in 2021. Other cities (i.e., [Chicago](https://ogletree.com/insights-resources/blog-posts/chicago-issues-proof-of-covid-19-vaccination-requirement-for-restaurants-gyms-and-indoor-concerts/)) did too, but they did so when a new COVID variant (Omicron) became viral, a critical confounder for clean identification.

## Why These Cities Matter

- Large, economically important metros  
- Early adopters of vaccine mandates  
- Clear policy onsets and enforcement timelines  
- Urban outliers in the national policy landscape


## Expected Employment Channels

- Supply side:
  - Worker compliance or exit  
  - Staffing frictions  
- Demand side:
  - Consumer confidence  
  - Willingness to dine indoors  

Net effects are theoretically ambiguous.


## Contribution of This Chapter

- First causal analysis of vaccine mandates on restaurant employment  
- Focuses on labor market outcomes, not health metrics  
- Evaluates mandates as an economic policy tool



## Empirical Strategy

- Compare treated cities to synthetic counterfactuals  
- Use MSAs without similar mandates as donors  
- Focus on year-over-year employment growth  
- Separate analysis by city



## Data

- Monthly MSA-level employment data  
- Source: BLS / FRED  
- Time span: 1991–2022  
- Outcome:
  - Full-service restaurant employment  
  - Leisure and hospitality employment


## Why This Design Works

- Sharp policy timing  
- No national mandate during study period  
- Rich pre-treatment histories  
- Comparable untreated metropolitan areas
