## Executive Summary

- **The problem**: SCMs are essential for geo-testing and policy analysis, but current tools are fragmented and hard to automate.

- **The solution**: `mlsynth` — a lightweight Python library that unifies 20+ SCMs behind one API and runs cleanly in CI/CD.

- **The impact**:
  - Multi-method estimates in minutes (minimal learning curve)
  - Automated geo-tests via GitHub Actions
  - Faster, reproducible insights for ad campaigns and policy

- **Tripadvisor benefit**: Python-first workflows that match team skills and production needs.

---

## What Are SCMs?

Synthetic Control Methods (SCMs)estimate *what would have happened* without the intervention by building a counterfactual from similar markets.SCMs estimate counterfacutals by creating a weighted average of untreated units.

SCMs are ideal for:

- Geo-testing ad campaigns across markets

- Evaluating local/national tourism policies (e.g., pricing, regulations)

The econometrics literature in recent years has seen a variety of SCM advances. Many such advances use machine-learning methods to augment the standard SCM.

**Tripadvisor use case**: Measure the impact of marketing campaigns or local policy changes.

## Practical Problems

- However, many of the recent SCM advances that Tripadvisor may benefit from have non-trivial startup costs. These costs inhibit their effective use.

- The first cost is purely software: not all SCMs are offered in one software. Furthermore, not all software is free.

- This makes it difficult to test different SCMs in a pipeline, especially given that other existing libraries (e.g., `pysoncon`, `tidysynth`, `augsynth`) differ in terms of data input expectations, options, and dependencies.

---

## Practical Problems cont.

Beyond simple software constraints, SCM tools often fail to:

- Support multiple methods in one workflow

- Provide automated diagnostics or effect-size statistics

- Facilitate easy comparison between methods

**Tripadvisor impact**: Manual/ad-hoc processes in Python/R slow down the implementation of SCMs for business-critical use cases.

---

## Practical Solutions

A streamlined SCM workflow for Tripadvisor should include:

- **Input**: A simple table with unit, time, treatment, and outcome
- **Method**: A single `.fit()` call
- **Output**: Effect estimates + diagnostics (e.g., fit quality, robustness)

**Tripadvisor benefit**: Enables rapid geo-testing across markets and policy evaluations with consistent, automated results.

---

## The Solution is `mlsynth`

`mlsynth` is a lightweight Python library which:

- Unifies multiple SCMs under one consistent API

- Integrates seamlessly into GitHub Actions or CI/CD pipelines for automated analyses

**Result**: Tripadvisor's analysts may focus on insights without wrestling with software logistics.

---

## Why use `mlsynth`?

- **For Tripadvisor’s analysts**:
  - Quick onboarding with one syntax
  - Extensible design to add new and bespoke SCMs
  - Transparent results for easy validation
- **For Tripadvisor’s organization**:
  - Production-ready workflows for geo-testing
  - Faster analysis, reducing campaign optimization time
  - Lower technical debt by eliminating R dependencies
- **For Tripadvisor’s leadership**:
  - Insights are delivered faster
  - Reduced friction from streamlined tools and automation

## Empirical Example: [Barcelona Hotel Moratorium](https://doi.org/10.1080/13504851.2021.1927958)

- **Intervention**: City-wide hotel building moratorium (July 2015)
- **Outcome**: Normalized hotel prices (anonymized, from Booking.com)
- **Control Units**: 83 cities (16 Mediterranean)
- **Time**: Weekly Data, January 2011 to  late 2017.
- **Findings**: We find the moratorium increase hotel room prices by roughly 12 percent.

## Using `mlsynth`

Here are the findings from three models.

```{python}

#| echo: False

import pandas as pd
from mlsynth import FSCM, CLUSTERSC, PDA
import plotly.graph_objects as go

# Load public tourism dataset
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jgreathouse9/GSUmetricspolicy/refs/heads/main/data/RawData/hotelex.csv"

# Fit Forward SCM

y_FSCM = arco.sub_method_results['FSCM'].time_series.counterfactual_outcome.flatten()
T0 = arco.raw_results['Fit']['Pre-Periods']

# Fit PDA (L2 method)
config_pda = dict(config)

# Fit Robust SCM

config_RSC["method"], config_RSC["cluster"] = "PCR", False

y_RSC = RSC.sub_method_results['PCR'].time_series.counterfactual_outcome.flatten()

# Create Plotly figure

# Add counterfactuals

# Add treatment line

    annotation=dict(font_size=12)

    x=185, y=140,
    showarrow=False,
    font=dict(size=14, color="white"),
    bgcolor="green", opacity=0.8
)

# Update layout
fig.update_layout(
    title="mlsynth Estimates of Moratorium's Impact on Barcelona Hotel Prices",
    title_font_size=18,
    xaxis_title="Time (Weeks)",
    yaxis_title="Indexed Price",
    legend=dict(orientation="h", yanchor="bottom", y=1.02, xanchor="center", x=0.5),
    template="plotly_white",
    showlegend=True,
    margin=dict(t=100),
    font=dict(size=12)

# Show plot
