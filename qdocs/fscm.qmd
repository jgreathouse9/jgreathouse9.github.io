# Intro
This post introduces the [Forward Selected Synthetic Control Method](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2024.111976). This method uses the Forward Selection method to choose the donor pool for synthetic control methods, and then uses that donor pool to fit the synthetic control predictions.

## Estimation in ```mlsynth```

As ususal, we begin by installing ```mlsynth```.

```bash
pip install -U git+https://github.com/jgreathouse9/mlsynth.git
```

And then we load the Prop 99 data and fit the model in the ususal ```mlsynth``` fashion.

```{python}
#| fig-align: center

import pandas as pd
from IPython.display import display, Markdown
from mlsynth.mlsynth import FSCM
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jgreathouse9/mlsynth/refs/heads/main/basedata/smoking_data.csv"
data = pd.read_csv(url)
config = {
    "df": data,
    "outcome": data.columns[2],
    "treat": data.columns[-1],
    "unitid": data.columns[0],
    "time": data.columns[1],
    "display_graphs": True,
    "save": False,
    "counterfactual_color": "red"}

arco = FSCM(config).fit()
```

After estimating, we can get the weights like

```{python}
weights_dict = arco['Weights'][0]
df = pd.DataFrame(list(weights_dict.items()), columns=['State', 'Weight'])
display(Markdown(df.to_markdown(index=False)))
```
These are the weights for all 17 units that were selected by the algorithm. As we can see, all of these even did not ultimately contribute to the synthetic control, with only 6 being assigned positive weight.
