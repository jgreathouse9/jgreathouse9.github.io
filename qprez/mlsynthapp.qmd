## 👋 Welcome

- *The MLSYNTH App* = point-and-click interface for causal inference  

- Wraps my [`mlsynth`](https://github.com/jgreathouse9/mlsynth) Python package  

- Designed for:
  - Policy analysts
  - Economists
  - Business owners
  - Data scientists  

---

## Motivation

- Policy evaluation needs credible counterfactuals  

- Synthetic control (SCM) provides a flexible framework, especially when the parallel trends assumption of DID does not hold.

- But today:
  - Fragmented implementations of different SCMs exist
  - Steep learning curve for different implementations of SCM
  - Not all researchers know R or Python, where many of these developments live

---

## Why Use the MLSYNTH App?

What are you really getting when you use MLSYNTH?

**Convenience.**

---

## The Problem

1. **Papers are hard to digest**

   - Some take days of rereading (e.g. PCR, RPCA)

   - Even straightforward ones (e.g. FDID) demand hours

2. **Code is fragmented**

   - Some estimators exist only in replication files

   - Others are in fragile, unpackaged R/Python scripts

   - Often tied to Stata or MATLAB (paid software)

---

## Time Costs

Rough estimates of time saved by MLSYNTH:  

| Estimator   | Hours to Learn + Code | MLSYNTH Time |
|-------------|------------------------|---------------|
| FDID        | ~40                    | Minutes |
| FSCM        | ~75                    | Minutes |
| RPCA        | ~90                    | Minutes |
| SI          | ~110                   | Minutes |

---

## Who Suffers Most?

- Even trained researchers spend *dozens of hours* per estimator  

- For the average policy analyst or master’s student:  

  - Multiply those hours by 2–4

  - Steep learning curve across stats, math, code, causal inference  

**MLSYNTH = a lifeline for non-technical users.**

---

## Two Ways to Pay

1. **Pay in Time**  
   - Learn Python + read the papers  
   - Use `mlsynth` source code directly  

2. **Pay in Money**  
   - Use the app  
   - Skip the coding, focus on analysis  

Either way,with the mlsynth app, you do not pay in both.  

---

## How It Works

1. Upload a panel dataset (unit, time, outcome, treatment)  
2. Choose an estimator  
3. Run the model → results visualized automatically  
4. Download outputs for further analysis  

---

## Sample Datasets

- **California Tobacco Law (1988)** → Cigarette sales  
- **German Reunification (1990)** → GDP  
- **Basque Terrorism (1975)** → GDP per capita  
- **Hubei Lockdown (2020)** → GDP growth  
- **Hong Kong Integration (2003)** → GDP  

---

## Available Estimators

- **FDID**: Forward Difference-in-Differences  
- **FSCM**: Forward-Selected Synthetic Control  
- **CLUSTERSC**: Cluster SCM (PCR, RPCA)  
- **SRC**: Synthetic Regression Control  
- **PDA**: Panel Data Approaches
- **FMA**: Factor Model Approach  
- **NSC**: Nonlinear SCM  
- **SI**: Synthetic Interventions

## Coming Soon

- Robustness checks (placebo tests)

---

## A Word of Caution

- MLSYNTH ≠ black box  
- Estimators rely on assumptions  
- Misuse → misleading results  

Use MLSYNTH to **save coding time** — but rely on econometric intuition.
