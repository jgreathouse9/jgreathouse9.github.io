HiðŸ˜Š I am Jared Amani Greathouse. Currently, I am a public policy PHD candidate at Georgia State, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Jason Coupet](https://aysps.gsu.edu/profile/jason-coupet/). Prior, I earned my Bachelors and Masters in political science from Georgia State University. I am the author of the [mlsynth](https://jgreathouse9.github.io/mlsynth/webdir/mlsynthlanding.html) Python package, the largest open source synthetic control package in the world.

I am an econometrician specializing in causal inference, *particularly* with the synthetic control method. My current work focuses on high-dimensional data and machine learning methods for treatment effect estimation.  If causal inference is your thing, check out [the software I develop](https://jgreathouse9.github.io/software/) for Stata and Python. Check out my [blog](https://jgreathouse9.github.io/docs/), "Policy Analysis, Data Science, and Causal Inference". Here I discuss causal inference, econometrics, and other data science topics for policy analysts. I am [also](https://www.statalist.org/forums/member/51320-jared-greathouse) an active contributor to the Statalist forum. [Here's my vita](http://jgreathouse9.github.io/files/VitaWeb.pdf).

If you'd like to talk with me about my work, [my consulting services](https://jgreathouse9.github.io/docs/consulting.html), or anything else that is of interest, you may always reach out to me!

## News

- Here are my [slides[(https://jgreathouse9.github.io/qprez/scmintro.html) (still being developed) that introduces the synthetic control method.

- As of August 29, 2025, [the landing page for mlsynth](https://jgreathouse9.github.io/mlsynth/webdir/mlsynthlanding.html) is up.

- As of October 6th, 2024, [my draft](http://jgreathouse9.github.io/publications/Replication_of_Shi_2023.pdf) of an empirical replication is available, where I compare and contrast the findings of the Forward DID method versus [the fsPDA](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2021.04.009), using the Chinese Anti-Corruption Campaign as an example. [Here](https://github.com/jgreathouse9/RepACCFDID/tree/main) is the replication code.

- As of September 27th, my draft for the Forward DID method is avaliable. [Here](http://jgreathouse9.github.io/publications/FDIDSJ.pdf) is the link to read it. Note that it is has not been submitted for review yet. Any comments or feedback would be appreciated.
