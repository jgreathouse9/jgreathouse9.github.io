# Introduction

**Jared Amani Greathouse**  
- PhD Candidate, Public Policy, Georgia State University  
- Advisor: Jason Coupet  
- Specialization: Econometrics and Causal Inference  
- Focus: Synthetic Control Methods, High-Dimensional Panel Data, Machine Learning for Treatment Effects  

---

## My Work

- Developed **mlsynth**, the largest Python SCM package to date  
- Suite of tools for policy evaluation using panel data  
- Supports dozens of estimators: vanilla SCM, cluster SCM, factor models, PDA, proximal SCM, and more  
- Handles complex, high-dimensional causal inference settings  

---

## What Makes MLSYNTH Special

- Consolidates decades of non-experimental SCM and panel methods from multiple software ecosystems into Python with **one singular syntax**  
- Easy installation, automation, and scaling  
- Supports a broad set of estimators for diverse research questions  
- **MAREX:** Market Experiment Design feature for selecting treated and control units under constraints  
- Decision-making tool: explore multiple scenarios with penalties, clusters, costs, budgetsâ€”overnight simulations possible  

---

## Challenges of Standard Experiments

- Randomized trials are often **impractical** at scale  
  - High coordination and cost  
  - Ethical or logistical constraints  
- Simple randomization ignores **pre-existing heterogeneity**  
- Cannot easily accommodate budgets, costs, or cluster structures  
- Slow to iterate: each new design requires manual planning  

---

## Why Prefer MAREX

- Optimizes **both treated and control selection simultaneously**  
- Enforces **cluster structure, budgets, and cardinality constraints**  
- Penalizes units far from cluster means to ensure representativeness  
- Allows **overnight simulation of multiple experimental scenarios**  
- Treats synthetic control as a **planning tool**, not just an estimator

## MAREX vs. Standard Experiment

| Feature | Standard Experiment | MAREX |
|---------|-------------------|-------|
| Randomization | Yes | No (decision optimization) |
| Budget-aware | No | Yes |
| Cluster-aware | No | Yes |
| Ethical / feasibility constraints | Hard | Built-in |
| Overnight scenario testing | No | Yes |
| Represents population structure | Often not | Yes, via synthetic control |

---

## Takeaway

- **MAREX is a planning tool** for experiments where randomization is expensive, infeasible, or restricted  
- Makes **representative, feasible, and comparable treatment assignments**  
- Analysts can **simulate, optimize, and justify experimental decisions** before implementation  
- Bridges **econometrics theory** and **practical business experiment design**
