Plenty of posts have been done in the last decade on [the synthetic control method](https://doi.org/10.1198/jasa.2009.ap08746) and related approaches; folks from [Microsoft](https://medium.com/data-science-at-microsoft/causal-inference-using-synthetic-controls-d96a890c83a7), [Databricks](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-do-causal-inference-using-synthetic-controls-ab435e0228f1), [Uber](https://youtu.be/j5DoJV5S2Ao?si=RWUYFjFEWpvkl8x1), [Amazon](https://towardsdatascience.com/causal-inference-with-synthetic-control-in-python-4a79ee636325), [Netflix](https://netflixtechblog.com/round-2-a-survey-of-causal-inference-applications-at-netflix-fd78328ee0bb), [Gainwell Technologies](https://andrewpwheeler.com/2019/12/06/using-regularization-to-generate-synthetic-controls-and-conformal-prediction-for-significance-tests/), and [else](https://rudrendupaul.medium.com/causal-inference-part-7-synthetic-control-methods-a-powerful-technique-for-inferring-causality-in-3ec5dbe26038)[where](https://henamsingla.medium.com/synthetic-control-method-a-z-d28099c56edb) have gone over it, detailing different aspects of the method. Many (not of course [not all](https://peerunreviewed.blogspot.com/2019/11/a-short-tutorial-on-robust-synthetic.html)) of these go over the standard SCM. Broadly, the original SCM tends to favor, under certain technical conditions, a sparse set of control units being the underlying weights. And while sparsity has plenty of appealing properties, such as our ability to interpret the synthetic control, sometimes this advice simply breaks down because [in some cases](https://ceistorvergata.it/public/files/RFCS/Giannone_illusion4-2.pdf) the sparsity notion is wrong. In other words, most of the coefficeints being 0 is a notion that cannot be defended. In this post, I demonstrate [the](10.13140/RG.2.2.11670.97609) $\ell_2$ panel data approach, an econometric methodology by [Zhentao Shi](https://zhentaoshi.github.io/) and [Yishu Wang](https://ishwang1.github.io/). This method accommodates dense data generation processes, or when the true vector of coefficient is mostly not zero.

```python
# Python example
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("World")
```


|   Column1 | Column2   |   Column3 |
|----------:|:----------|----------:|
|         1 | A         |       4.5 |
|         2 | B         |       5.6 |
|         3 | C         |       6.7 |


And now...
