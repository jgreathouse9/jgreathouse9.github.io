    "text": "In academia, lots of the datasets we tend to work with come in pretty csv files. And while that’s great… oftentimes, in modern policy data science, the data we seek are unstructured in the sense that they do not come from a specific file such as a .csv file or Stata dataset. Such data must be web-scraped, or the process of gathering unstructured data, via reproducible script.\nThis post simply seeks to present a simple use case of web-scraping in the setting the applied policy scientist might need for certain tasks. Say we wish to gather the price of gas from AAA, across each metro area in the nation. In the old days, we’d need to ask AAA and pay thousands of dollars for an extended time series… but now we don’t need to, at least for this case. The reason is because we have Python, and we are able to leverage its basic features to collect these data via exploiting the publicly available information they provide us."

For Massachusetts, the URL is “https://gasprices.aaa.com/?state=MA”. For Florida, the URL is “https://gasprices.aaa.com/?state=FL”. See the pattern? There’s a common prefix, with the only thing changing being the suffix of which is the abbreviation of the state.\nThe master function is fetch_gas_prices. This simply accepts a dictionary of state abbreviations (the value) paired with the key (the state name) we shall query over. We, within this function, define a common time mapping which AAA uses to stnadardize dates, and specify the current date.\nNext I use Python’s requests library to query each state (plenty of ways to do this step, but requests is generally the quickest for simple and even fairly big jobs). I then process each state with the process_states function. This accepts a list of states, headers, the common time mapping, and the current date. We then query each state, and clean the accordion-style tables that we see towards the bottom of the page. We clean them for each city/each metro area with the process_city_data function. Then append all of them into a single dataframe for each state, moving on to the next state after we’ve axhausted all metros for that state. Finally we appened the state dataframes together, where we have the date, the prices of gas, the state, and the city name all in one place."

I’ve done more complicated scrapes, such as scraping the prices of goods across every Whole Foods in the country across 5 different departments per store. The scale of the job and the size of the data is much bigger, but the principles are overall the same. In the future, I will write more posts that demonstrate different applications of web-scraping and how policy scientists may use them. In particular, I will cover how scraping can go hand in hand with GitHub Actions. In my experience so far as a PHD student, these two alone (scraping and Github Actions) has made my life as a researcher far easier than otherwise."

    "text": "I began my dissertation last week. The first chapter studies the causal impact of Texas’ repeal of the tampon tax on consumer demand as well as consumer price savings. Naturally, I’ll be using synthetic control methods as one may have guessed to answer this question. I was in the middle of doing the literature review, my favorite part of the research process. Upon doing some digging, I had to write a post about this. I found a paper which is titled “Why current menstrual policies do not work”. Much of the framing of the paper is actually fine, until we get to the part about evidence regarding the tampon tax. King writes\n\nSimilarly, a recent UK campaign to abolish a 5% ‘tampon tax’ unintentionally boosted the profits of disposable product manufacturers by about £15 million per year, without substantially reducing the cost of products for consumers,\n\nciting this paper at this link. I read this and thought “Hmm, I wonder what their identification strategy is.” So I went to look up the paper King cites. The paper, written by Tax Policy Associates, studies the pass through effects of abolishing the tampon tax (in the U.K.) on savings to consumers. For quick refernece, I grab the data from their Github and plot the treated unit (a normalized estimate of tampon sales) versus the trajectory of the controls. Instantly, we can see that this is an extremely high dimensional dataset.

We were able to do this because the ONS includes tampons (but not other menstrual products) in the price quotes it samples every month to compile the consumer prices index. Since 2017, the ONS has published the full datasets for its price sampling.\n\nOkay fine. No problems so far. The authors find “Overall, the average price for [tampons in] the period after the VAT abolition is about 1.5% less than it was beforehand.” Still no issues so far. But then we check the methodology that they link to… and the results were less than exciting, putting it quite politely. Why? The authors do a simple t-test. That is, a simple pre-post test which compares the mean difference of tampon prices before the abolition of the tax and after the abolition of the tax. Precisely, they write\n\nApply [sic] statistical techniques to these datasets is not straightforward given the limited number of datapoints and very high degree of volatility. It was, however, thought appropriate to run an unequal variance one-sided t-test (using the python SciPy library) to compare the pricing datasets for the six months before 1 January 2021 with those for the subsequent six months.\n\nI read this and I was kind of horrified. Thought appropriate? By who? Who said this was a good idea? Who would look at this and say it is okay, especially for a written publication that people are going to cite? Look, I get it. I know that real data are often messy and that as data scientists we have to take steps to compensate for noise, corruption, and overall lack of cleanliness… but I must be clear about something: no matter what the extant difficulties are, this is not at all the correct way to do things. In fact, I’m going to prove it in this post, beyond saying “it’s just a t-test, so therefore it’s bad”. To really understand what is wrong here, we have to discuss the role of data generating processes and why they matter. All the time, we see statisticians write about low-rank models or linear factor models, and I’m not sure policy analysts or data scientists actually consider what they mean for applications."

    "text": "DID\nFor DID, we presume the outcome \\(y_{jt}\\) is (at minimum) generated by:\n\\[\ny_{jt} = \\lambda_j + \\delta_t + \\epsilon_{jt},\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\lambda_j\\) is the unit-specific fixed effect, \\(\\delta_t\\) is the time-specific fixed effect, and \\(\\epsilon_{jt}\\) is the idiosyncratic mean zero error term. All this means is that each outcome we see in the spreadsheet is generated by some common time effect and unit specific effects. We begin by taking expectations, as this removes the error term. When we do this, we are left with\n\\[\n\\mathbb{E}[y_{jt}(0)] = \\lambda_j + \\delta_t.\n\\]\nNow, consider two periods, \\(t\\) and \\(t^{\\prime}\\). The expected untreated outcome at time \\(t\\) is \\(\\lambda_j + \\delta_t\\), and at time \\(t^{\\prime}\\) it is \\(\\lambda_j + \\delta_{t^{\\prime}}\\). The difference between these expected outcomes is:\n\\[\n\\mathbb{E}[y_{jt}(0)] - \\mathbb{E}[y_{jt^{\\prime}}(0)] = (\\lambda_j + \\delta_t) - (\\lambda_j + \\delta_{t^{\\prime}}) = \\delta_t - \\delta_{t^{\\prime}}.\n\\]\nNotice that the unit fixed effect \\(\\lambda_j\\) goes away. The difference in expected untreated outcomes depends only on the time effects \\(\\delta_t\\) and \\(\\delta_{t^{\\prime}}\\). This result applies both to the treated unit and to the control group. For the treated unit, denoted as \\(j = 1\\), the expected difference is:\n\\[\n\\mathbb{E}[y_{1t}(0)] - \\mathbb{E}[y_{1t^{\\prime}}(0)] = \\delta_t - \\delta_{t^{\\prime}}.\n\\]\nFor the control group, averaging over all units \\(j \\in \\mathcal{N}_0\\), we obtain:\n\\[\n\\mathbb{E}[y_{\\mathcal{N}_0 t}(0)] - \\mathbb{E}[y_{\\mathcal{N}_0 t^{\\prime}}(0)] = \\delta_t - \\delta_{t^{\\prime}}.\n\\]\nThis is saying that absent treatment, the equality\n\\[\n\\mathbb{E}[y_{1t}(0)] - \\mathbb{E}[y_{\\mathcal{N}_0 t}(0)] = \\mathbb{E}[y_{1t^{\\prime}}(0)] - \\mathbb{E}[y_{\\mathcal{N}_0 t^{\\prime}}(0)]\n\\]\nholds across all periods, including the post-intervention period. In other words, the difference between the treated and control units would remain constant over time, even absent the treatment. The groups do not need to have the same levels of outcomes; they only need to share the same average trends over time. This of course is the parallel trends assumption, which we can already see in plenty of work which extends this idea to the staggered adoption setting."

In the pre-treatment period, the expected outcome for unit \\(j\\) is:\n\\[\n{\\color{red} \\mathbb{E}[y_{jt} \\mid d_{jt} = 0]} = \\mathbb{E}[\\lambda_j + \\delta_t + \\epsilon_{jt} \\mid d_{jt} = 0]\n\\]\nSince \\(\\lambda_j\\)and \\(\\delta_t\\)are both constant for a given unit and time, the expected outcome simplifies to:\n\\[\n{\\color{red} \\mathbb{E}[y_{jt} \\mid d_{jt} = 0]} = \\lambda_j + \\delta_t + {\\color{red} \\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon_{jt} \\mid d_{jt} = 0]}\n\\]\nSimilarly, in the post-treatment period, the expected outcome for unit \\(j\\)is:\n\\[\n{\\color{blue} \\mathbb{E}[y_{jt} \\mid d_{jt} = 1]} = \\mathbb{E}[\\lambda_j + \\delta_t + \\epsilon_{jt} \\mid d_{jt} = 1]\n\\]\nSince \\(\\lambda_j\\)and \\(\\delta_t\\)are again constant, this simplifies to:\n\\[\n{\\color{blue} \\mathbb{E}[y_{jt} \\mid d_{jt} = 1]} = \\lambda_j + \\delta_t + {\\color{blue} \\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon_{jt} \\mid d_{jt} = 1]}\n\\]\nNow, we compute the difference in expected outcomes between the pre-treatment and post-treatment periods for the treated unit\n\\[\n{\\color{blue} \\mathbb{E}[y_{jt} \\mid d_{jt} = 1]} -\n{\\color{red} \\mathbb{E}[y_{jt} \\mid d_{jt} = 0]}\n\\] This is just the t-test estimator expressed in terms of expectations. Substituting the expressions above into this, we get:\n\\[\n\\left( \\lambda_j + \\delta_t + {\\color{blue} \\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon_{jt} \\mid d_{jt} = 1]} \\right)\n-\n\\left( \\lambda_j + \\delta_t + {\\color{red} \\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon_{jt} \\mid d_{jt} = 0]} \\right)\n\\]\nSince both \\(\\lambda_j\\)(unit fixed effect) and \\(\\delta_t\\)(time fixed effect) are present in both terms, they cancel each other out:\n\\[\n{\\color{blue} \\mathbb{E}[y_{jt} \\mid d_{jt} = 1]} -\n{\\color{red} \\mathbb{E}[y_{jt} \\mid d_{jt} = 0]}\n=\n{\\color{blue} \\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon_{jt} \\mid d_{jt} = 1]} -\n{\\color{red} \\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon_{jt} \\mid d_{jt} = 0]}\n\\]\nNote that this would holds even for an interactive fixed effects model.\nFor the pre-post t-test to be valid, we essentially must assume that the error terms \\(\\epsilon_{jt}\\)are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) between the pre-treatment and post-treatment periods. This means that any difference in outcomes should be due solely to the treatment effect, not due to other unobserved factors.\nThe assumption is that the expected difference in error terms is zero:\n\\[\n{\\color{blue} \\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon_{jt} \\mid d_{jt} = 1]} - {\\color{red} \\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon_{jt} \\mid d_{jt} = 0]} = 0\n\\]\nThus, the difference in expected outcomes for the treated unit simplifies to:\n\\[\n{\\color{blue} \\mathbb{E}[y_{jt} \\mid d_{jt} = 1]} - {\\color{red} \\mathbb{E}[y_{jt} \\mid d_{jt} = 0]} = 0\n\\]\nThis result implies that any observed difference in outcomes between the pre- and post-treatment periods must be entirely due to the treatment effect and noise, assuming no confounding factors or time-specific shocks.\nWhy did I bother to derive all of this? Why should policy analysts care? Well, we care about having unbiased and consistent estimates of our treatment effect estimand. Estimators are grounded in some form of data generating process which has implications for their ability to do the task we care about. Parallel trends made by DID, while strong, is a much more defensible assumption than the one you’d need to make for a truly valid pre-post treatment t-test. DID says (even for multiple treated units under staggered adoption) that so long as our control group is parallel with respect to the treatment group, our ATT is identified. The assumptions of the t-test takes even time based confounding away- which basically is never true in real life.\nIn fairness, the Tax Policy Associates authors do recognize these shortcomings, writing\n\nThe prices of tampons and the other consumer goods considered in this paper will be affected by numerous factors… this makes it difficult to separate real trends from noise. More sophisticated statistical methods than a t-test are therefore not helpful (difference-in-difference and synthetic control methods were attempted, but did not produce meaningful results).\n\nThey do not share their code for either the latter, but I will share mine. I agree with them that there are plenty of confounding factors (mostly unobserved) and noise that we have to attempt to account for. In such situations, we should turn to modern econometrics instead fitting the data to a method."

    "text": "Picking a donor pool is very important with the synthetic control method. The vanilla method suffers from interpolation biases in the case when the donor pool is not suitable for the target unit. This is farily common with applied SCM in real life, as oftentimes we may have a high-dimensional donor pool and not know what the right control units would be a priori. The standard advice given in this instance is to limit our control group to units that are already similar to the target unit. But how do we do this? One way is to use clustering methods to select the control group. Consider the classic Basque Country example below, where the Basque Country undergoes a wave of terrorism in the mid-1970s which is thought to impact their GDP per Capita relative to other areas of Spain.\nHere, we plot the Basque versus the average of its controls as well as the individual donor outcome vectors themselves. We can see that the Basque Country is one of the wealthiest areas of Spain, up there with Madrid, Cataluna, and the Balearic Islands. We have other donors too, which by comparison are less wealthy. The key, then, is to ask which donors we should select for the synthetic control algorithm to consider in the first place, by exploiting pre-intervention similarities between the treated unit and control group. With “better” pre-policy donors, there is a higher chance that our out-of-sample predictions would be closer to the actual counterfactual."

    "text": "Takeaways for Practitioners\nThe meaning of these results are quite simple: donor selection matters for SCM studies. In fact, simple machine-learning donor selection methods can oftentimes give the same or similar answers to classical studies which oftentimes used covariates (in the original SCM paper, Abadie and his advisor used 13 covariates to construct the counterfactual, returning Cataluna and Madrid as the weighted donors). I say oftentimes because these results are predicated on both assumptions and tuning parameters. We assume, for example, some low rank approximation exists that can fit the pre-intervention time series of the treated unit. The tuning parameters matter too– the lambda parameters control the sparisty of our results, for example. I use a simple herustic to tune it, but it may be more reasonable to use methods such as cross-validation to select the number of clusters or the values lambda should take, but this would demand simulation evidence.\nEither way, the main benefit for policy analysts is that these two methods offer ways to select a donor poor for synthetic control methods, on top of not needing to collect auxilary covariates that the original paper used to obtain very similar counterfactual predictions, and more work should be done on these estimators to see when and why they’d agree."

On one hand, we could physically do this ourselves, but this leaves us open to errors: for one, if we’re scraping a dataset from a website, what if the data are only there temporarily? What if it only exists for today, and then tomorrow it is updated with the then current data? What if we are away from our computers, and cannot be there to run script on our local machine? Surely, there must be a solution to this, and one such solution is Github Actions, which I learned about as an intern at Gainwell Technologies.\nThis post explains Github Actions in a very short, simple to intuit example. Of course, their applications are so vast that I cannot cover everything about them here, but they are still very useful to people who do a repetitive/very similar set of tasks over and over again."

It begins by naming the action to be performed, which is to scrape some city level gas price data. It is scheduled to run at 9:30 UTC time, or at 4:30 each morning Eastern Standard Time, with the cron time. It may also run whenever I wish for it to run; alternatively, we can specify that some actions run on push to a repo, branch, or even a certain working directory.\nname: City Level Gas Price Scraper\n\non:\n  schedule:\n    - cron: '30 9 * * *'\n  workflow_dispatch:\nActions proceed by defining a set of jobs for the workflow to excecute. In this case, it’s just “scrape”, but you can define more jobs that are interdependent on one another. The job runs on a virtual computer, in this case Ubuntu. Jobs proceeds with a list of steps, or an order that the job proceeds in os the action can function. Step one is to checkout the repo, which essentially just clones the current repo on to the virtual machine.\njobs:\n  scrape:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n    - name: Check out repository\n      uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\nStep two here is to set up Python, since that’s the language I use, but I’m certain this may be done with R and other langauges (in fact, this entire blog is written in Quarto, which the action must install before working with each post). Note how we specify the version of Python here, too. We then install pip and the requirements that the Python code needs to run the scrape.\n    - name: Set up Python\n      uses: actions/setup-python@v4\n      with:\n        python-version: '3.9'\n\n    - name: Install dependencies\n      run: |\n        python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n        pip install -r requirements.txt\n\nNow, we simply run the code, which is no different practically speaking from running the code from our command line. Note that how the file is defined within a driectory, which must be specified if the python file is not at the root (different ways of doing this).\n\n    - name: Run gas scraper\n      run: |\n        python \"City Scrape/cityscrape.py\"\n\nNext, I make the directory for the data if it does not exist.\n\n    - name: Ensure directory exists\n      run: |\n        mkdir -p \"City Scrape/Data/\"\n\nAnd finally, we commit the csv file my code creates to the directory at the repo. We use the Github Actions bot to do the commit. If there are no changes between any of the files before and after committing, we don’t add them and then the job ends (this is what happens if I try to run the action after it’s ran already that day). If not, the files are pushed. In my case, the files are named things like City_2025-01-31.csv. These files are staged, or prepared for being committed, with the addition of the commit message that I’m updating the data for that day. Then we push them to the directory of interest, and then job complete.\n    - name: Commit and push updated CSV to repository\n      run: |\n        git config --global user.name \"GitHub Actions\"\n        git config --global user.email \"github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com\"\n        \n        # Check if there are changes before committing\n        if git diff --quiet && git diff --staged --quiet; then\n          echo \"No changes detected, skipping commit.\"\n          exit 0\n        fi\n        \n        git add \"City Scrape/Data/City_*.csv\"\n        git commit -m \"Update gas prices data for $(date +'%Y-%m-%d')\"\n        git push https://x-access-token:${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}@github.com/${{ github.repository }}.git HEAD:main\n      env:\n        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n\nThe real value of this is not the data I’m scraping (unless you’re a fuel economist/policy scholar). The value is that this job runs independent of my will. I do not have to be at my computer for this to run. I do not need to worry about whether my computer has power or whether I’m home to personally oversee it. The value here is that I’ve manually gotten my computer to do a specific task every single day, the correct way (assuming you’ve coded everything right!!!), every time. Of course, this job is so insignificant such that I did not feel the need to run additional safechecks (say AAA’s site is down, I could have the action restart in 6 hours, or have it curl the website on the hour until it does respond), but obviously you can do plenty more here if the task matters enough. This is also a very partial list of what may be done. You can also place lots of parameters around your actions that may make life easier, or employ pre-commit hooks which can do checks for the quality of the code and other tasks before anything is committed, which will fail if they are not satisfied.\nAlso, it’s worth noting that Actions may run in conjunction with cloud computing for larger-scale jobs. So, if you’re a policy researcher, and your org uses Github but not using Actions for all kinds of process automation tasks, these provide a very useful tool to handle repetitive actions that free up your time to do other things. After all, a key benefit of script is to automate the boring stuff, provided that we’ve automated our tasks correctly."

    "text": "Plenty of posts have been done in the last decade on the synthetic control method and related approaches. It is a flavor of artificial counterfactual estimator for the panel data setting. Folks from Microsoft, Databricks, Uber, Amazon, Netflix, Gainwell Technologies, and elsewhere have written about/covered it, detailing its implementation, use cases, and econometric theory.\nMany (not all) of these cover the standard SCM, developed originally to study terrorism in the Basque Country and conduct comparative case studies more broadly. Standard SCM tends to favor, under certain technical conditions, a sparse set of control units being assigned weights. These weights aim to reconstruct the factor loadings/observed values of the treated unit, pre-intervention. Sparsity, or the true coefficient vector being mostly 0, has appealing properties; for example, a sparse vector allows us to interpret the synthetic control a lot easier, facilitating the estimation of leave-one-out placebos and other sensitivity checks. In some cases though, the sparsity notion is unfounded.\nThe the \\(\\ell_2\\) panel data approach is an econometric methodology developed by Zhentao Shi and Yishu Wang. The \\(\\ell_2\\)-PDA is a form of synthetic control estimation that accommodates sparse or dense data generation processes. A dense DGP is when the true vector of coefficients is mostly not zero. Sometimes, a sparse model is too simplistic, especially in settings where we have very many predictors. This is especially true when we have lots of multicollinearity among our predictors, which may be very plausible in settings with a lot of control units. The LASSO and the convex hull SCM (for different reasons and in different cases) generally struggle with this, whereas the Ridge or \\(\\ell_2\\)-PDA accomodate multicollinearity as a feature. In this post, I demonstrate the method as implemented in my library mlsynth. The Python code for these results may be found here."

The sup norm of a vector \\(\\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^N\\) is defined as the maximum absolute value of its components, \\(\\|\\mathbf{y}\\|_\\infty = \\max_{j = 1, \\ldots, N} |y_j|\\). The floor function of a real number \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\), denoted as \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor\\), returns \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor = \\max \\{k \\in \\mathbb{N} : k \\leq x\\}\\). Let \\(t \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) and \\(i \\in \\mathbb{N}\\), represent the indices for \\(T\\) time periods and \\(N\\) units. The pre-treatment period consists of consecutive time periods \\(\\mathcal{T}_1 = \\{1, 2, \\ldots, T_0\\}\\) (cardinality \\(T_1\\)), while the post-treatment period is given by \\(\\mathcal{T}_2 = \\{T_0 + 1, \\ldots, T\\}\\) (cardinality \\(T_2\\)). The treated unit is indexed by \\(i = 1\\), while the remaining set of units, \\(\\mathcal{N}_0 \\coloneqq \\{2, \\ldots, N_0 + 1\\}\\) (cardinality \\(N_0\\)), forms the control group. Each outcome for all units is denoted by \\(y_{it}\\).

While \\(d_{it} = 1\\), a unit is treated and while \\(d_{it} = 0\\) a unit is untreated. Thus, \\(y_{it}^1\\) is the potential outcome under treatment, \\(y_{it}^0\\) is the counterfactual (or potential) outcome under no treatment. The objective is to estimate the counterfactual outcomes \\(y_{1t}^0\\). SCMs and panel data approaches are weighting based estimators. In this setup, some weight vector \\[\n\\mathbf{w} \\coloneqq \\begin{bmatrix} w_2 & w_3 & \\cdots & w_{N_0+1} \\end{bmatrix}^\\top, \\: \\text{where } w_i \\: \\forall \\: i \\in \\mathcal{N}_0.\n\\] is assigned across the \\(N_0\\) control units to approximate the treated unit’s pre-intervention outcome.

The constraint of the convex hull disallows extrapolation of any form. SCMs are predicated on good pretreatment fit, such that \\(\\mathbf{w}^\\top \\mathbf{Y}_0 \\approx \\mathbf{y}_1\\). Speaking generally, the better pre-treatment fit we have over a long time series, the better the out-of-sample predictions will be for the synthetic control."

Too high a value of \\(\\tau\\) results in drastic underfitting (trust me) of the pre-treatment data. The way mlsynth tunes tau is by cross-validation over the pre-treatment period. mlsynth invokes a log-space over the interval \\(\\tau \\in \\left[ 10^{-4}, \\tau_{\\text{init}} \\right]\\), where \\(\\tau_{\\text{init}} = \\|\\boldsymbol{\\eta}\\|_\\infty\\).
