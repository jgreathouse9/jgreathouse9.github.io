## Counterfactual Estimation

- Much of what governments/businesses do is predicated on specific (policy) interventions affecting some set of outcomes.
- Methods such as Difference-in-Differences and Synthetic Control Methods (DID and SCM) are often used to estimate counterfactuals, where some set of units are treated at one time point, and others are not treated. Both are predicated on using weighted averages of control groups in the pre-treatment period to predict counterfactuals.

## Counterfactual Estimation cont.

- However, existing methods have may struggle in certain instances. SCM struggles with high-dimensional datasets. Often, smaller donor pools are prefereable to very large ones. Similarly, DID requires $\mathbb{E}[y_{1t}(0)] - \mathbb{E}[y_{\mathcal{N}_0 t}(0)] = \mathbb{E}[y_{1t^{\prime}}(0)] - \mathbb{E}[y_{\mathcal{N}_0 t^{\prime}}(0)]$.

## Benefits of mlsynth

- **Forward Difference-in-Differences (FDID)**
  - Better parallel trends
- **$\ell_2$ Relaxer**
  - Handles multicollinearity better than LASSO.
- **Robust PCA SCM**
  - Uses better PCA

## Example: FDID in Action

```{python results="markup"}
print("I am Jared")
```
