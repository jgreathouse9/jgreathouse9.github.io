# Philosophy

The mlsynth library implements machine learning based synthetic control estimators for program evaluation, offering a convenient API which implements multiple flavors of synthetic control estimation. Unlike other libraries which rely on numerous methods for plotting, weights, and estimation, mlsynth classes rely on a simple `.fit()` method to run any given estiamtor, where users may customize the options via a simple input dictionary.
