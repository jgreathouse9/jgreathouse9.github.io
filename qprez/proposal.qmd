# Introduction

Jared Amani Greathouse

- Advisor: Jason Coupet

## A World Where Policy Cannot Be Avoided

- Pandemics are not individual-level risks
- Exposure is:
  - Non-optional
  - Non-local
  - (Generally) Non-isolable
- Outcomes depend heavily on:
  - Government action
  - Collective behavior
- COVID-19 forced policy decisions at massive scale

## The Central Policy Tension During COVID-19

- Policymakers faced a fundamental tradeoff:
  - Mitigating public health risks
  - Preserving economic and social well-being
- Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) aimed to:
  - Reduce transmission and health system strain

- But also imposed:
  - Employment and income losses
  - Tourism and service-sector disruptions
  - Broader economic consequences


## Current Literature

- Existing literature emphasizes health impacts (e.g., case growth, hospitalizations)
- For example, researchers [studied](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2114226119) how opening of NFL stadiums impacted the spread of the virus or how [lockdowns](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00072) affected case rates.
- Far less is known about secondary outcomes:
  - Economic activity, labor markets, environmental outcomes
- Key question:  
  *Can policies protect public health without causing large economic or social harms?*

## Why Identification Is Hard

- Pandemics create a latent, system-wide “background treatment”:
  - All units are exposed in some way
  - Policies respond to this background risk
  - Spillovers and network effects are pervasive
- Implications for evaluation:
  - SUTVA is often violated
  - Untreated control units are hard to identify
  - Standard DiD or SCM approaches can fail
- Observed outcomes may conflate policy effects with the underlying pandemic shock

## Implications for Policy Analysis

- Traditional evaluation strategies struggle to isolate policy impacts
- Challenges for applied policy studies:
  - Assessing effectiveness under universal exposure
  - Distinguishing policy-driven changes from collective behavioral responses
  - Translating empirical findings into actionable guidance

- Solutions require:
  - Careful construction of counterfactuals
  - Methods that account for spillovers and shared shocks

## Role of Machine Learning

- Enhances counterfactual estimation by:
  - Flexibly modeling complex dynamics (such as, low rank matrix estimation)
  - Selecting relevant control groups
  - Mitigating spillover effects
- Essential for pandemic-era policy evaluation

## Technical Motivation

- Many modern causal inference methods lack ready-to-use software
- Existing SCM tools in R, Stata, and Python:
  - Very limited in scope
  - Cannot easily implement novel identification strategies
- To address this gap, [I developed](https://mlsynth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) **`mlsynth`**, an open-source Python package

**`mlsynth` enables:**

- Flexible synthetic control and panel data methods
- Machine learning tools to address spillovers, high-dimensional donor pools, and SUTVA violations

## Paper 1: Hawaii’s COVID-19 Quarantine

**Question:**  
What were the short-run economic costs of Hawaii’s March 2020 mandatory quarantine?

**Method:**  
Synthetic Historical Control (SHC)

**Outcomes:**  
- Tourism demand  
- Labor market conditions  
- Statewide economic activity


## Why Hawaii?

- Most extreme U.S. COVID containment policy, more so than any other state in the country
- Introduced a mandatory 14-day quarantine on *all* arrivals (March 26, 2020) until September 2020
- *Effectively* sealed borders and shut down tourism
- No comparable U.S. state intervention


## Core Policy Question

**What are the economic costs of decisive early action under uncertainty?**

- Early containment may prevent long-run damage
- But imposes large short-run economic losses
- Critical for future crises:
  - Pandemics
  - Climate shocks
  - Geopolitical disruptions

- A key question is the degree to which the intervention impacted the economy, in contrast to places like Florida who did not such restrictions.

## Difficulty in studying this case

- Hawaii is:

  - Geographically isolated

  - Highly tourism-dependent

  - Economically distinct from most states, being heavily tourism dependent

- No credible untreated comparison units, meaning standard DiD and SCM designs will fail

## The Identification Problem

- COVID-19 is a *global* shock
- Nearly all regions experienced treatment
- No clean donor pool of nations of even other economic metrics exist
- Cross-sectional comparisons break down

## Economic Outcomes

**Tourism Demand**
- Visitor Days
- Hotel Occupancy

All measured as:
- Annualized year-over-year growth rates

## Data

- Monthly time series
- 30 years of pre-treatment data (1990 to 2020).
- Sources:
  - Hawaii Department of Business Economic Developmemt and Tourism
- Treatment begins: March 2020

## Methodological Solution

**Synthetic Historical Control (SHC)**

- Uses the treated unit’s *own past*
- Constructs counterfactuals from historical segments
- Requires no geographic control units
- Designed for:
  - One-off shocks
  - System-wide interventions

## SHC Intuition

- Match the *last pre-treatment window*
- Using weighted combinations of:
  - Earlier historical segments where intervention was not active.
- Learn how Hawaii typically evolves, absent either pandemic or lockdown
- Extrapolate forward absent treatment


## Inference

- Placebo tests in time
- Conformal prediction intervals
- Distribution-free
- 90% out-of-sample coverage

## Contribution

- First causal estimate of Hawaii’s quarantine effects
- Demonstrates SHC in an extreme policy setting
- Provides evidence on economic costs of near-zero-COVID policies
- Broad relevance for crisis policymaking


## Paper 2: Impact of National Lockdown on Air Quality in India

## The COVID-19 Lockdown

- On March 25, 2020, India began a strict lockdown to combat the spread of COVID-19.
- Among the strictest globally  
- Sudden halt to:
  - Transportation  
  - Industrial activity  
  - Construction  
- While the first order indicator is spread of the virus, there was also a large carbon emissions shock

## Motivation

- Air pollution is one of India’s most severe public health challenges  
- Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is the primary pollutant of concern  
- Chronic exposure affects over 1.4 billion people  
- Persistent exceedance of WHO and national standards


## Sources of PM2.5 in India

- Vehicular emissions  
- Industrial production  
- Construction activity  
- Biomass burning (household and agricultural)  
- Seasonal and meteorological factors


## Severity and Spatial Variation

- National average PM2.5 far exceeds WHO guidelines  
- Large regional heterogeneity:
  - Indo-Gangetic Plain: extreme winter pollution  
  - Major metros consistently among the world’s most polluted (especially Delhi).
- Pollution is persistent, not episodic


## Health Impacts

- Long-term exposure increases:
  - Cardiovascular disease  
  - Respiratory illness  
  - Stroke and lung cancer  
- Air pollution causes ~1.5 million premature deaths annually  
- Substantial reductions in life expectancy, especially in Delhi

## Economic Impacts

- Significant healthcare expenditures  
- Reduced labor productivity  
- Losses in tourism and agriculture  
- Estimated costs ≈ 1–1.5% of GDP annually  
- Policy response: National Clean Air Programme (NCAP)

## Lockdown as a Natural Experiment

- Policy applied uniformly across the country  
- Sharp timing and clear intervention onset  
- A rare opportunity to study large-scale emissions reductions  
- Particularly relevant for national-level air quality


## Observed Changes During Lockdown

- PM2.5 declined sharply across monitored locations  
- Reductions often in the range of 30–50%  
- Major metros experienced large AQI improvements  
- Effects strongest in early lockdown phases

## What Existing Studies Show

- Consistent evidence of pollution declines during lockdowns  
- Findings documented across:
  - India  
  - China  
  - Europe  
- Effects observed for PM2.5, NO₂, and PM10


## Dominant Empirical Approaches

- Pre–post comparisons  
- Year-over-year comparisons  
- Graphical trend analysis  
- Satellite imagery  
- Simple regression models


## Limits of Existing Evidence

- Largely descriptive  
- No explicit counterfactual construction  
- Confounding from seasonality and weather  
- Limited policy relevance


## Causal Approaches in the Literature

- Interrupted Time Series (ITS)  
- Synthetic Control and augmented SCM  
- Causal machine learning methods  
- Mixed findings across contexts


## Methodological Gap

- Few credible causal designs for national-scale interventions  
- Makes the SHC method a natural candidate

## Data

- *Source:* SHRUG – Socioeconomic High-resolution Rural-Urban Geographic Data Platform for India
- *Spatial coverage:* 635 districts across India  
- *Temporal coverage:* Jan 1998 – Dec 2020 (monthly observations)  
- *Outcome:* PM2.5 concentrations, population-weighted at district level  

**National-level analysis:**
- Population-weighted average across all districts → single monthly time series

*Treated districts (city-level analysis):*
- Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Kolkata (major tech hubs/metropolitan areas).
- Aggregated subdistricts to district-level averages

## Data Transformation

- Compute year-over-year (YoY) growth rates of PM2.5:  

  - Compares each month to same month in previous year

- Final outcome series for analysis:  
  - **National:** YoY growth of PM2.5 across India  
  - **Cities:** YoY growth for each treated district  

- Restricts analysis to 1999–2020, months 13–312 of the dataset

## Contribution of This Chapter

- First causal evaluation of India’s nationwide lockdown on PM2.5.
- If successful, illustrates how government action like this can significantly mitigate emissions in the short term.

## Paper 3: Locking Away Prosperity? Evaluating the Labor Impacts of Vaccine Mandates


## Motivation

- COVID-19 NPIs initially focused on lockdowns and masks  
- Early research emphasized timing and public health benefits  
- Subsequent work documented economic and labor market costs  
- Less is known about later-stage pandemic policies

- One key policy passed by many jurisdictions was the idea of vaccine passports/mandates.


## From Lockdowns to Mandates

- Vaccines became widely available by early 2021  
- Policymakers sought alternatives to broad lockdowns  
- Vaccine mandates emerged as a targeted intervention  
- Goal: protect public health while sustaining economic activity


## Why Focus on Restaurants?

- High-contact, indoor settings  
- Central to urban leisure economies  
- Sensitive to both consumer confidence and labor supply  
- A leading concern during mandate debates


## Policy Question

How did city-level vaccine mandates affect restaurant employment?

- Did mandates slow employment recovery?  
- Or did they support demand by improving perceived safety?  
- Are effects consistent across cities?


## Treated Cities

- New York City (August 2021)
- San Francisco (August 2021)
- New Orleans (August 2021)
- Los Angeles (November 2021)

Each implemented vaccine mandates for indoor dining in 2021. Other cities (i.e., [Chicago](https://ogletree.com/insights-resources/blog-posts/chicago-issues-proof-of-covid-19-vaccination-requirement-for-restaurants-gyms-and-indoor-concerts/)) did too, but they did so when a new COVID variant (Omicron) became viral, a critical confounder for identification.

## Why These Cities Matter

- Large, economically important metros  
- Early adopters of vaccine mandates  
- Clear policy onsets and enforcement timelines  
- Urban outliers in the national policy landscape

## Expected Employment Channels

- Supply side:
  - Worker compliance or exit  
  - Staffing frictions  
- Demand side:
  - Consumer confidence  
  - Willingness to dine indoors  

Net effects are theoretically ambiguous.


## Contribution of This Chapter

- First causal analysis of vaccine mandates on restaurant employment  
- Focuses on labor market outcomes
- Evaluates mandates as an economic policy tool

## Empirical Strategy

- Compare treated cities to synthetic counterfactuals, using staggered adoption SCM methods
- Use MSAs without similar mandates as donors  
- Focus on year-over-year employment growth  
- Separate analysis by city

## Data

- Monthly MSA-level employment data  
- Source: BLS / FRED  
- Time span: 1991–2022  
- Outcome:
  - Full-service restaurant employment 
  - Leisure and hospitality employment
  - Both as Year on Year Growth rates


## Why These Outcomes Matter for Policy

- Pandemic policy is, in principle, a joint health–economic decision problem
  - Governments do not choose policies based on epidemiological outcomes alone
  - Economic consequences shape political feasibility, compliance, and long-run welfare

- While health effects may be transient, economic impacts can persist even after the virus goes away
  - Industry contraction
  - Labor market scarring
  - Changes in regional economic structure

- Outcomes studied in this dissertation capture these longer-run margins:
  - Tourism: regional exposure to mobility and border restrictions
  - Restaurant employment: labor market recovery in high-contact sectors
  - Air pollution: economic activity and mobility responses beyond reported statistics

- Credible counterfactuals for these outcomes allow policymakers to:
  - Assess short-run costs versus long-run consequences
  - Distinguish temporary disruptions from lasting damage
  - Evaluate whether decisive action under uncertainty pays off

- Substantively, this work helps answer:
  > *Can non-pharmaceutical interventions protect public health without imposing persistent economic harm?*
