title: "MLSYNTH"
subtitle: "A Machine Learning Synthetic Control Library Using Python"
---

This is the landing page for the mini-ecosystem `mlsynth`. In terms of the raw number of synthetic control estimators, it is the largest open source library that exists.

**Contributors**: Jared Greathouse

**Status**: Beta version released. Documentation and app are in active development.

## Philosophy

The mlsynth library implements machine learning–based synthetic control estimators. Unlike other libraries that require users to juggle separate methods for fitting, prediction, plotting, weights, etc., `mlsynth` simplifies everything into a single `.fit()` call. All estimator options are passed through a single configuration dictionary. This means you can switch between models within a class with almost no change in your code, or change classes at will. For example,

```{python}
#| eval: false

# Forward SCM, Forward Augmented SCM, and Forward Differnece-in-Differences

import pandas as pd
from mlsynth import FSCM, FDID

url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jgreathouse9/mlsynth/refs/heads/main/basedata/smoking_data.csv"
data = pd.read_csv(url)

# base config
config = {
    "df": data,
    "outcome": data.columns[2],
    "treat": data.columns[-1],
    "unitid": data.columns[0],
    "time": data.columns[1],
    "display_graphs": True,
    "save": False,
    "counterfactual_color": ["red"]
}

# Forward SCM
arco = FSCM(config).fit()

# Augmented Forward SCM
config_aug = dict(config)
config_aug["use_augmented"] = True
arco_aug = FSCM(config_aug).fit()

# Forward Difference-in-Differences
fdid = FDID(config).fit()
```

runs two different flavors of the [Forward Selected SCM](https://mlsynth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fscm.html) and [Forward DID](https://mlsynth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fdid.html). Furthermore, we can do this with essentially zero change in the data structure or input requirements beyond simple changes to a dictionary.


## GitHub Repo

Here is the GitHub [repo](https://github.com/jgreathouse9/mlsynth). You may install mlsynth by doing

```bash
pip install -U git+https://github.com/jgreathouse9/mlsynth.git
```

in your terminal.
