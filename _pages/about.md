HiðŸ˜Š I'm Jared Amani Greathouse. I am an econometrician specializing in causal inference, *particularly* with the synthetic control method and difference-in-differences. Currently, I'm a public policy PHD candidate at Georgia State and the Georgia Institute of Technology, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Jason Coupet](https://aysps.gsu.edu/profile/jason-coupet/).

Check out my under-development "```mlsynth```" [Python](https://github.com/jgreathouse9/mlsynth) library. It implements various artificial counterfactual estimators for panel data. I am [also](https://www.statalist.org/forums/member/51320-jared-greathouse) an active contributor to the Statalist forum. [Here's my vita](http://jgreathouse9.github.io/files/VitaWeb.pdf). If you'd like to talk with me about my work, my consulting services, or anything else that's of interest, you may always reach out to me!
